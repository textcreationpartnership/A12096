            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, my ſalutation ſhall be with a few aduertiſements and requeſts vnto thee. Firſt, whereas I often vſe theſe phraſes, <hi>The miracles of Antichriſt, Antichriſtian miracles,</hi> or ſuch like, my meaning is not, to giue vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt or his Miniſters, power to doe wonders, which are <hi>in ſe</hi> and ſubſtance <hi>ſupernaturall:</hi> for thoſe bee the <hi>Mirabilia,</hi> which <hi>Dominus ſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 72. 28.</note> by his immediate power, vnto which all his creatures, and the <hi>nothing,</hi> out of which his creatures are made, are ſubiect by an obedientiall power or ſubjection: but I call the prodigies of Antichriſt <hi>Miracles,</hi> becauſe in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſeduced, they are ſuch; and becauſe ſacred Scriptures, as Antiquity hath expounded and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doe ſo terme them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I requeſt thee, peruſing my twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou paſſe not thy iudgement haſtily thereon, vntill thou haue read the whole contents of the ſame, and then as thou ſhalt finde, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> iudge; whether I haue not, at leſt very probably diſputed, according to the ſenſe of
<pb facs="tcp:17944:8"/> our Sauiours propheſie, and Context of the Text; giue me leaue in this, <hi>Fungi vice Cotis,</hi> to whet the wits and pens of the more learned, to examine the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of that admirable propheſie of our Lord Ieſus, which I there handle: <hi>Quicarpet mea edat ſua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if in the proſecution of this argument, I do interlace ſome particulars, and vſe ſome phraſes which may ſeeme tart to the Aduerſaries <hi>pallate,</hi> the Reader may not be iuſtly offended thereat: for they doe inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, ſo a buſe all <hi>Reformed Clergies,</hi> &amp; Chriſtian Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, with their calumnious imputations, that there is no end nor meaſure of their malice: and as for phraſes, their pens &amp; mouths can hardly find any bad enough for vs. Againe, ſuch is the nature of the argument, which I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in this Treatiſe, that it cannot bee well proſecuted without Tart termes to the Aduerſaries taſte. If any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Cleargy which are <hi>Siders</hi> to the Popes facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe diſtaſte my matter or my <hi>ſtile,</hi> I ſhall no more regard their diſlikes, then I will the barking of a curriſh whelpe. Such hypocrite-Clerkes what are they elſe, then the very <hi>Scumme</hi> of this Church, and the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which being, <hi>nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And heere I defire the Chriſtian Reader to be aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that ſuch <hi>Conuerts</hi> as come from Rome (if ſincere and conuerted in their ſoules) are ſure to bee beſet with diuerſe ſorts of Aduerſaries: as the Papiſts and their <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the Semi-Browniſts or fiery Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cifianiſts, and their Fauourers, and to the hard cenſures of all ſuch; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ſound <hi>Conuerts</hi> are certaine to be ſubiect: The firſt taxing them as not ſound, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues playing the hypocrites, and meaſuring others by their own laſts, doe hold them for like diſſemblers: loth they are that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reputed learned or honeſt, ſhould be thought to bee
<pb facs="tcp:17944:8"/> ſincerely, and in truth, conuerted to the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or to bee well eſteemed of, or prouided for by the ſame.</p>
            <p>The other kinde, more vnkinde; taxe and reprooue ſuch, becauſe in their preachings and practiſes, they are firme and zealous for the maintenance of thoſe articles (Chriſtian and Apoſtolicall) Canons (Goodly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to which they haue ſubſcribed. Ioyntly both ſorts of them haue their eyes ſet ſo narrowly and inceſſantly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and their doings, that the leaſt errour they may commit either in priuate conuerſation, or by lapſe of tongue (which as the Apoſtle deliuereth, no mortall <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 8.</note> man can perfectly rule or tame) ſhall be made a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but why write I this? to curry fauour, or to begge <hi>indulgence</hi> at any mans hands? <hi>Abſit:</hi> no man without Arrogancie, can aſſume that of Chriſt to himſelfe; <hi>Quis ex vobis &amp;c.

Becauſe it toucheth the ſincerity of our religion, which theſe by ſecret whiſperings and ſurmiſes, ſeeke to ſtaine and wound: and I verily thinke if in any kinde of calumnie, in this, that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is moſt true, <hi>Qui negligit famam crudelis eſt: He who neglecteth his fame is cruell againſt himſelfe.</hi> I hope then that wee ſhall not be reputed contentious, if wee call any to anſwer for their calumnies againſt vs, if they ceaſe not to blemiſh the integrities of our Faith, wherein (I doubt not, but that I may ſpeake the like of my brethren) I neuer knew what hypocriſie meant: no, no: wee leaue that for our Church Papiſts and Communion-Recuſants, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that diſh as due to ſuch as ioyntly <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for our ſelues, who in the feare of God haue ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Iugum Exactoris, the yoake of the Exactour;</hi> wee <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.</note> haue by Gods bleſſings a double ſtaffe of comfort, the one firme as the euerlaſting mountaines: Our faith and hope is that we are, <hi>Filij liberae Children of her that is free,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 22.</note> and <hi>Liberti Domini, Free-men of the Lord,</hi> which liberty the Lord Ieſus hath graciouſly beſtowed vpon vs: from <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 22.</note> whom we pray, and hope for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch a good meaſure of his grace, that we ſhall not vſe this liberty as an occaſion of ſinne; but liue more warily, by how much wee are hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in with Aduerſaries on euery ſide, <hi>Sed ex his omnibus liberabit nos Deus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another ſtaffe or cauſe of comfort vnder God to ſuch Conuerts as alreadie are come, or hereafter may happily come, may be, to thinke, that we haue a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> who doubtleſſe doth from his very hart, embrace and loue thoſe <hi>Conuerts</hi> which are in heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.
<pb facs="tcp:17944:9"/> There are alſo of his Subiects both of higheſt and loweſt ranke of all ſorts (I meane ſuch as are ſincere Chriſtian Proteſtants, and leane to neither ſide directly nor indirectly) who doubtleſſe doe in their hearts loue vs, and are very glad when they haue occaſion to doe, or heare of any good that is done vnto vs. What neede ſuch then care if either <hi>Preciſians</hi> on the one ſide, or <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the other, doe maligne them, <hi>Si Deus nobiſcum; (&amp; Dij eius nobiſcum) quis contra nos.</hi>

            <p>But ſeeing it pleaſeth the Popiſhly affected, (I meane <hi>Church Papiſts,</hi> whether Laikes or Clerkes) to be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and ſo prone to cenſure vs late <hi>Conuerts;</hi> as vnſound, and yet in hearts Popiſh; I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to giue me leaue to <hi>Character</hi> them out in a word or two in their right collours.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17944:12"/> in a few (amongſt innumerable other) cleare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. As firſt, their preſumptuous Canonizing into the ranke of ſacred Scriptures, apocriphall bookes of errable men, ſo reputed, and eſteemed by venerable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie. Againe, their vaine preſumption in defining their metaphyſicall and paradoxicall tranſubſtantiation, by which, (out of thoſe moſt venerable and ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall words of Chriſt, <hi>this is my body,</hi> by an admirable <note place="margin">Math. 26. Luk. 22.</note> kinde of logicke, neuer heard of nor dreamed of in the auncient Fathers) they doe by tranſubſtantiation place and ſet their Chriſt, in ſuch a manner of being, ſite, and diſpoſition of body, within the round wafers, which they conſecrate; that I could neuer as yet heare any one of them dare to affirme, in what ſort Chriſt is there, whether ſitting, ſtanding, or lying; whether prone, or ſupine, with his face vpward, or downeward; whether like <hi>Ianus bifrons double-fore-headed,</hi> or with as many faces, as there be imaginary parts in the wafer: This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the way, I giue the Reader to vnderſtand, that when their famous <hi>

                  </note> in the Ignatian ſchooles at Rome was treating of the manner of Chriſts being in their ſacrament, he did then, and there (not without admiration and aſtoniſhment to my ſelfe) deliuer, that looke howſoeuer, and in what ſort, and manner ſoeuer, the deuout Receiuer, will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Chriſt to be there, whether as ſtanding vpright, or as ſitting or like as hanging vpon a croſſe, hee ſhall ſo haue him truely and realy: his reaſon was, becauſe Chriſt, is in the ſacrament in like ſort as mans ſoule is in his body, <hi>totus in toto &amp; totus in qualibet parte, whole Chriſt in euery part of the wafer and whole Chriſt in the whole wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;</hi> ſo that although the whole face of Chriſt be in the whole wafer, and in euery part of the wafer, and the feet of Chriſt be in the whole wafer, and in euery part of the wafer, yet it is (ſaid hee) in the power of the Receiuer, to imagine the face, to be in one part, the hands in an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17944:13"/> other, the breſt in the third, and the reſt in other parts, in ſuch ſort, as might beſt ſerue for his deuotion. And that this doctrine was there publikely deliuered, I call the heauens to witneſſe; but what neede I, ſo to do? when this their ſuperſtitious diuinity, is ſo frequently taught, and deliuered in their meditations and pulpits: and it is ſo agreeing to that their principle, that <hi>Chriſt is wholie in euery part, and wholy in the whole wafer;</hi> that by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence it followeth thereout, as the intelligent Reader will eaſily obſerue.</p>
               <p>Further a third inſtance I adioyne of their doting and fatuouſe indulgences, which are ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded and grounded in any expreſſe practiſe of the primitiue Church; that the acuteſt of themſelues confeſſe, and acknowledge; that they were only impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely deliuered, in thoſe words to <hi>Peter, whatſoeuer thou</hi>

By all which, with infinite more inſtances, it is as cleere as the very heauens, that they doe beleiue many things as neceſſary points of religion, which the ancient Church neuer dreamed of. And when vpon this point they are vrged and tould (as Chriſt taxing the Iewes errours ſpoke to them) that <hi>ab initio non erat ſic, from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> Abraham <hi>non fecit ſic;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 19. 8.</note> Chriſt, his Apoſtles, the primitiue Church, did not ſo; then they recurre to their rotten ſanctuary: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the primitiue Church did not ſo expreſſely, yet they did ſo implicitely, although they did not ſo beleiue in expreſſe tearmes, yet they did ſo beleiue <hi>(in principijs)</hi> in thoſe principles, and premiſſes, out of which their Holy father by his vnerring Spirit, hath deducted theſe new concluſions, and vpon whoſe declaration, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and beleiue them, as the very Oracles of God.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17944:13"/> But how is this diuinitie confronted by the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Galat: 1. 8. 9.</note> who hath denounced an <hi>Anatheme</hi> to him, whoſoeuer ſhall deliuer as matter of faith (for ſo the Apoſtle muſt be vnderſtood) beſide what was then deliuered? how can the Pontficians ſhew me, any commandement of God, by which I am bound to beleeue new articles of faith, which were not expreſly beleeued, and receiued in the Apoſtles times, and primitiue Church? by what <note place="margin">This is catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith and profeſſion, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, Martyrs haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; which the faithfull hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto do keep. <hi>Vigil:</hi> againſt <hi>Eutich.</hi>
                  </note> principles, can they euince, that the faith which was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Apoſtles, and their immediate ſchollers, is not ſufficient for the faithfull of this time? by what ſcripture, or authoritie of any ancient Father can they ſhew, that the Pope can deliuer new Articles of faith touching manners, which were not beleeued in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church? ſurely by none: and yet they trauaile egerly therein; but their iſſue being fruitleſſe, and they not being able to be deliuered of a maſculine childe, to defend this their paradoxe, they recurre and runne to that vaine and fond bulwarke of all Heretikes, and falſe Prophets; miracles forſooth, prodigyes, viſions and wonders muſt be deuiſed, there they reſt, there they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and ſing: but before the victorie; as eaſily I (by Gods aſſiſtance) will make it manifeſt in this my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, reſt they, triumph they, inſult they neuer ſo much.</p>
               <p>The manner of the Papiſts vrging of their miracles, prodigyes and viſions, is ſo peculiar, and eſſentiall to <hi>Antichriſtianiſme,</hi> and to the great <hi>Patriarke</hi> of the ſame, the man of ſinne and ſonne of perdition; that I ſuppoſe there are no paſſages of ſacred Scripture, which do more clearely euince poperie to be Antichriſtianiſme, and the Pope to be the man of ſinne, then that they ſo egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſult for their falſe prodigyes, and tryumph for their lying viſions; that if it were poſſible, they would <note place="margin">Matth: 24.

Beleeue it courteous Reader the abominations which are committed by thoſe purpured Fathers, and the Supreame Fathers of that Synagogue are ſo deteſtable, that they paſſe all nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration either of modeſt or immodeſt penne: and if our ignorant Pontificians in England, bee not acquainted with this, or thinke that I doe of purpoſe aggrauate; God is my witneſſe I doe not ſo. But the true cauſe, that they are ſo vnacquainted with <hi>Romes</hi> impurities and impudicities is, that all their <hi>Seminary-Prieſts, Monkes,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:17944:20"/> 
                  <hi>Ieſuits</hi> whatſoeuer, haue euer moſt ſtrict charge giuen vnto them before they returne into England not to ſpeake of anything, which in any reſpect, may turne to the diſhonor of the Pope, or his purpured brethren. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for moſt part they are ſo cloyſtered vp, that they haue litle conuerſation with thoſe that know the liues &amp; conuerſations of <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> both <hi>intus</hi> and <hi>in cute;</hi> and yet the Colledge is not ſo euen builded but that ſome ſtones ſtand further out, then the reſt and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are of better intelligence. And the deteſtably impure, proude, and luxurious liues of <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> is indeede the cheefeſt cauſe, why <hi>Italy</hi> ſo ſwarmeth with <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and why few ingenuous Chriſtians entring into it, are euer peruerted or drawne to their hereſyes and Idolatries. I except ſuch youthes, as are corrupted in the <hi>Fry,</hi> or neuer looke without their Seminary-mewes, or elſe ſuch <hi>ſcioppyes,</hi> as for <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſerue <hi>Pluto.</hi> And thus much by the way of their <note place="margin">Of this matter the Reader may find more in the eight Chapter.</note> doctrine of Deuills, and of their diueliſh practiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding marriage, vnder pretence of greater chaſtity, and Antichriſtian puritie, (I call it Antichriſtian puritie becauſe it is, the immediate root and cauſe of all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, flatly repugnant to the ordinance of God, nature, &amp; the lawes of Grace) tying men by lawes and vowes, to that which their own conſciences tell them they cannot keepe, and obſerue. And for this reſpect I here conclude that both this doctrine and their practiſe thereof muſt needes be from the Deuill.</p>
               <p>But to diſcourſe more in Generall, that this marke of teaching doctrines of Deuills, can by no meanes, bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the reformed Churches, it is thus to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. Becauſe all that they teach, as neceſſarie to bee beleeued; is poſitiuely, truely, and really conteined, in the ſacred Scriptures, and ſymbole of the Apoſtles, as they haue beene expounded by the moſt Auncient, and Catholike Church, and therefore by no waies, can their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17944:21"/> doctrines be called of Deuills; vnleſſe the Auncient, &amp; Catholike Church, may be apeached of ſuch a crime. But the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> through the preſumptions of their <hi>Popes</hi> haue made many <hi>additaments</hi> to faith, of which ſome for ſpeciall reſpects are called doctrines of Deuills; and all in generall, for that, either they are deuiſed by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Deuills, or approued by them. The which is clearely declared thus; becauſe they wanting teſtimonies of ſacred Scriptures for moſt of theſe their hereticall patches and additaments; they doe often returne vnto the dead, ſcraping thence, what horrible teſtimonies they can get; contrarie to the inſtruction of Chriſt, who to damned <hi>Diues,</hi> deſirous to goe to his liuing brethren, and to inſtruct them that they might auoide that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, into which he was fallen, anſwered thus; <hi>they haue</hi>

The Fryer would euer haue to doe with the maide after his exorciſing, and coniuring of her; and before he would vndertake to coniure her againe, he would be aſſured to go to confeſſion, &amp; cry <hi>peccaui:</hi> the which he did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding often, as I haue been moſt credibly informed from <note place="margin">A notable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening tricke of a <hi>Fryer</hi> with an <hi>Energumeniſſe.</hi>

               <p>Another circumſtance, whereby we may euidently gather, that the deuills haue a great hand in popiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, rites, and ceremonies, is this; that the diuells themſelues (a thing which cannot be denied) are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and delighted with the very ſame and ſelfe-things, which are moſt ſacred amongſt the <hi>Pontificians:</hi> as for example, their <hi>Agnus-deies,</hi> their <hi>holy water,</hi> their <hi>bleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> their <hi>palmes,</hi> their <hi>waxe candles,</hi> their <hi>croſſes,</hi> and often <hi>croſſings,</hi> (their croſſings and often croſſes I ſay, for otherwiſe the ſigne of the croſſe vſed in Baptiſme, and as a ceremonie, I cannot ſee how it ſhould be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, or magicall) their <hi>ſtoles, maniples, veſtments,</hi> yea their conſecrated <hi>hoſtes,</hi> and ſacred <hi>Euchariſts;</hi> with which, that the deuills themſelues are <hi>pleaſed,</hi> and <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> no man can denie, who hath euer heard of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of coniurers; who hath euer read, the ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of witches, ſorcerers; who hath euer ſeene the inſtruments of them, which they vſe in their myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: for they vſe euen popiſh ſtoles, maniples, veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, candles, holy water, conſecrated oyles, &amp;c. I know what the learned <hi>Pontificians</hi> will pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things, they will ſay forſooth, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth emulate Gods honour; true, in ſuch worſhips <note place="margin">The deuill is delighted with the ſacredſt things that are in Poperie.</note> as he himſelfe deuiſeth; but how is it imagineable hee ſhould emulate Gods honour, in vſing and reſpecting thoſe things, which the Popiſh Church, with bell, booke
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17944:25"/> and candle, with all her ſacred breath, breathing, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating the H: Ghoſt vpon them, doth eſpecially or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne, appoint, and preſcribe, to be vſed againſt the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, illuſions, &amp; inchantments of the deuils. This is that myſterie of iniquitie, which I deſire the learnedeſt Dowiſts to vnfould; and to ſhew, how the deuills can deſire to be honoured, reuerenced and worſhipped, by ſuch things; and themſelues to reuerence and regard ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by their Church, with all her power, are bleſſed &amp; preſcribed againſt them. I challenge all the <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> to ſhew if they can, that the deuills were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and pleaſed, with the very ſacrifices of God in the ould Teſtament; or by any ſuch things, as were bleſſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron;</hi> or that now they are pleaſed with any thing of religion, which the reformed churches deliuer, and as they deliuer, teach, and preſcribe them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the deuills concurring to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of popiſh doctrine and practiſes, in nothing doth appeare more clearely, then in their damnable doctrine of equiuocation, which is nothing elſe, but flatlying, whereof the deuill is principall <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Authour,</hi> for <hi>he was a murtherer and a lyer from the beginning,</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">Ioh: 8.</note> Goſpell. Here I deſire the Reader, to giue me leaue to relate two equiuocating trickes of two <hi>Ignatian Prieſts,</hi> one worthy of deteſtation, the other of laughter.</p>
               <p>There was in the Countie of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a fiery and furious litle Prieſt, well knowne to my ſelfe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others in <hi>Rome.</hi> This Perſon attempting with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to haue oppreſſed a young maide, which came to him to confeſſion, was reiected by her, and vpon her out-cry, his Clerke (which was in the next roome, and <note place="margin">A notorious periurie of an Ignatian Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17944:25"/> taken: being taken, with ſolemne oath he denieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a Prieſt (like as one <hi>Komes</hi> an Ignatian Prieſt in the Clinke did the like with ſolemne oath to the laſt Lord of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> but afterward being conuicted to be a Prieſt, by one that dwelt neere, and had knowne him in <hi>Rome,</hi> he to excuſe himſelfe, ſaid that hee did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocate, and that when hee denied himſelfe to bee a Prieſt, he ment he was not Prieſt of <hi>Baall,</hi> and ſo this holy Ignatian, (who neuer aſcended into the Sicomore tree to behold Chriſt, with ſincere <hi>Zacheus</hi> to repent;) thought his credit ſufficiently ſalued. This wicked wretch, not long after was baniſhed, by vertue of that gratious proclamation, which was publiſhed preſently after the diſcouery of the powder-treaſon. Being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his firſt entertainment was to be a Ghoſtly Father for ſtrangers at <hi>Noſtredame du Hall</hi> neere <hi>Bruſſells;</hi> from thence, he was preferred to bee Ghoſtly Father in the Campe amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where hee profited ſo well, that thence he hath recollected himſelfe to <hi>Louayne</hi> to <hi>Saint-Iohns</hi> mount, where he lately plaide the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnder Father <hi>Talbot,</hi> hoping after his nouice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſhip to be Ignatianed. Where willingly I leaue him, wiſhing that he may ſtill there continue.</p>
               <p>The other true tale is of one <hi>Thomas Cornford,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, the courteous Reader may obſerue, that at his examination, before my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> taken the 25. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1612<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did firſt giue vnto him ſelfe the name of <hi>Iohn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwood,</hi> and ſo ſubſcribed it; affirming, that he was a married man; and that hee had married the daughter of one <hi>Robinſon,</hi> in <hi>Irkingburge,</hi> where his wife alſo, then, at the time of his examination remained: he added alſo, that he had beene married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her twelue yeares, and that, he had by her, ſixe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and being examined, about his going to miſtreſſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux;</hi> his anſwere was, that being, himſelfe was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a Farmer, he went to Miſtreſſe <hi>Vaux,</hi> to intreate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17944:26"/> her, to moue the Lord <hi>Vaux;</hi> that he himſelfe, might be Tenant to his Lordſhip, for a certaine houſe and land, lying in <hi>Irkingburge,</hi> where his wife <hi>Robinſons</hi> daughter remained. This being in effect, the ſubſtance of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, at the firſt of his examinations, he acknowledged and ſubſcribed vnto the ſame, by the name of <hi>Iohn Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my Lords Grace, vpon ſome occaſion of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, putting this man off for a time, hee, either vpon ſome remorſe of conſcience, or fearing, leſt his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſtate, might, by ſome other meanes be diſcouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth of himſelfe offer, to manifeſt vnto his Grace, his condition and profeſſion; vnto which, as it were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſecond examination he is admitted: where, he firſt, acknowledgeth himſelfe for the ſpace of ſixe yeare, to haue beene brought vp in the Colledge of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that there, he tooke the orders of Prieſthood, according to the manner of that Church; and that from thence, ſome 12. yeares ſince, he was ſent by miſſion into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: where by Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> he was admitted into the ſociety of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> he acknowledgeth alſo, that his name was <hi>Thomas Cornford,</hi> and ſo ſubſcribed the ſame the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; after, that before, hee had ſubſigned by the name of <hi>Iohn Vnderwood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader will here expect, to vnderſtand how this ingenious and Saint-like Ignatian, did conciliate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſuch contrarie ſayings of his; ſurely thus hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his part, and demonſtrated himſelfe a worthy <hi>Rabby</hi> in the Ignatian Academie of equiuocating, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, lying: whereas he affirmed himſelfe, to be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man; his meaning was, that his wiſe was his breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie; and that hee had beene married vnto it, twelue yeares; as for his children, which hee had by <hi>Robinſons</hi> daughter, thoſe were his ghoſtly and ſpirituall children. But yet, the wily man (being demaunded thereof) could not well ſhew, how his wife the Breuiarie, became <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſons</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:17944:26"/> daughter: and here being at a ſtand, hee was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen out by his Grace that in probability, his Breuiarie was <hi>Robinſons</hi> daughter, becauſe it might be, that the Printers name, who printed it was <hi>Robinſon.</hi> The reaſon, why he called himſelfe a Farmer, was becauſe he was ſo to God, according to that text, <hi>Redde rationem villicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tuae: Giue an account of thy Farmerſhip.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he ſaid, that he went to Miſtreſſe <hi>Vaux,</hi> to take a farme of the Lord <hi>Vaux;</hi> was, becauſe he was ready, to doe them any ſeruice, for their ſaluation, and for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall tilling of their ſoules. Whereas hee had denied himſelfe, to haue beene beyond the ſeas; his anſwere was, that he ſpoke that, with intention, that he had bin there, but not, that hee was bound, to tell his Grace ſo much. Thus in effect with much like ſtuffe paſſed the Holy Ignatians examination; out of which, the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader may clearely inferre, how egregiouſly theſe men, ſhew themſelues, to be impes of him, who was <hi>(mendax ab initio, a lyer from the beginning)</hi> and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, theſe men, and none but theſe, (if, it may ſo pleaſe the Gods) are only ſincere, holy, Chriſtian, Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. For my part I cannot but thinke, that Father <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> ſince his engrafting into Ignatianiſme, and Garne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, became an Equiuocater; for in <hi>Rome,</hi> hee was poſſeſſed, with ſuch a doultiſh kinde of ſimplicity, that it is a kinde of miracle, that he ſhould ſo eaſily haue been transformed into another man: well it may be obſerued herehence, how efficacious the Garnetian Academie hath beene for training youth in lying, cogging, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating.</p>

This Doctour ſpeaketh moſt truly of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be done by Gods permiſſion, both by Heretikes and Magicians; but I cannot but maruell at his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, where he teacheth, that the actions and acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of ſuch prodigies, ſhould be ſupernaturall; ſurely his head was ſupernaturall, when he dreamed ſuch diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; for I neuer yet read any learned Chriſtian, who durſt teach that the prodigious acts of Magicians, or Heretikes, except they be extraordinarily endewed with a miraculous faith, and doe them by the immediate power of God, ſhould be in themſelues (that is in their ſubſtance and nature) ſurpaſſing the boundes, limits, and force of naturall cauſes: for I neuer learned otherwiſe, no not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but that all miraculous workes done by Magicians and Heretikes, were euer done, by the ſecret, hidden, quicke and ſpeedy application of naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the vertues of which are well knowne to Satan, who is the cheefe and principall Agent in ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17944:31"/> in theſe their prodigies, is by ſecret application, and meanes of naturall cauſes, God in his good pleaſure, permitting them ſo to doe, for the deception of thoſe, who deſerue to be deceiued.

For popiſh miracles haue certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, making them of leſſe credit then thoſe of the Panymes: as for example, they are ſeldome or neuer ſeene to be done, by any indifferent witneſſes, but are commonly firſt done, then ſpoken of; few there are, which ſee the euills from which their perſons pretend to be deliuered; but fewer ſee their deliuerance. At <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, Loretto, Noſtre dame du hall,</hi> and elſewhere at their miracle-ſtages, a man may liue many a yeere, before he ſhall ſee any one miracle done in publike view, and ſight of the Church: but many forſooth, come from farre places, pretending deliuerance, and theſe commonly are poore, are commonly women, and ſome ſuch creatures; and their deliuerances be commonly from ſome infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which the deuills may performe, and this lightly alwaies vpon their vowes: in which kinde, if one by chance or phyſicke recouer, for a hundred who periſh,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17944:31"/> by and by as it were with ſound of trumpet, there muſt be a miracle, a prodigie: truly, their follies and vanities herein, with an indifferent and an vnpartiall eye being conſidered, will either procure laughter, or compaſſion, they are ſo many, ſo manifold.</p>

                  <q>O fatuas Gentes, quibus talia numina.</q>
                  <p>To conclude, this is the ſumme of that which may be anſwered to that vnto which you direct Sir <hi>Edward</hi> in S. <hi>Auſten;</hi> firſt, we acknowledge that at the <hi>memorie, of S. Steephen</hi> many miracles were done in confirmation of Chriſtian religion; Secondly we grant there was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable remembrance of that Saint; Thirdly we deny that thoſe miracles were done to proue interceſſion or prayers to that Saint; no, no; there is no mention made of interceſſion or praiers to him; but, put caſe, M. <hi>Flud,</hi> that it might be thought in thoſe times, that ſome of thoſe miracles were obtained by the praiers of that Saint
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17944:47"/> (I doe not ſay the prayers of liuing to that Saint) to God, what could you inferre thereout, but an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie bleſſing which may not be drawne into an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie example?</p>
                  <p>But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Flud,</hi> admit we grant all you deſire (which yet by no meanes I may) that the Chriſtians of thoſe times did pray to <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> and did thinke they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſome benefits by ſuch their praiers, muſt this their action, be a neceſſarie example for vs, that wee may or ought to doe like? Can ſuch a practiſe make it an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Rule of manners, according to the analogie of faith to all future ages? Muſt the priuate practiſe of ſome primitiue Churches, tye all the vniuerſall Church, and this for all ages? If ſo; what then will become of your Church, which out of an opinion of libertie, doth not adminiſter the ſacrament to the Laitie vnder both kindes, which the ancient Church euer did, out of an opinion of neceſſitie grounded vpon Chriſts command and inſtitution? Why then doth not your Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſacrament of the Euchariſt to Infants newly baptized, as the ancient Church did, out of an opinion of neceſſitie for their ſaluation? Why then doth not your Church continue profeſtiuall night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vigills, which Antiquitie both approued and required?</p>
                  <p>Time was in the ould Law, when it was not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeful, but alſo neceſſarie for ſuch as were ſtrucke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſerpents, if they would be cured, to behold the brazen Serpent; but afterwards when the ſame was abuſed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly, call to minde how good King <hi>Ezechias</hi>

It is one thing <hi>Sir</hi> to haue a picture of Chriſt burnt or defaced in deſpite of Chriſt, or to be defaced in deſpight of Idolatrie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the ſame, whereby Chriſt is diſhonoured.

Some of your owne Papiſts deny the miracles done at <hi>Sichem,</hi> ſo doe alſo the <hi>Heretikes</hi> (as you call them) what, will you ioyne theſe together?

                  <p>But admit wee grant that your Hiſtories are true, and that Satans flight at the ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> made by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was inforced; what if God for the confuſion of that <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and for the glory of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> which <hi>Iulian</hi> out of ſpight and hate of Chriſt deſpiſed, did put that terrour into <hi>Satan</hi> by the ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> that he was affrighted therewith? I thinke Sir there is no Orthodox Chriſtian who will denie, but that God might doe it for ſuch an end, and ſo <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is to be interpreted. Nay I tell you more M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Flud,</hi> the Church of England is no enemie to the ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> for ſhee commandeth the ſame religiouſly to be vſed in the adminiſtration of the ſacrament of Baptiſme, neither ſhall you finde any of the learned and Orthodoxe Diuines of the church of England to condemne the ancient Orthodox Chriſtians vſe of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in teſtimonie of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt infidells, but your magicall abuſes thereof. As, for that which you cite out of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> touching the bodie of <hi>Babilas</hi> Martyr, I anſwer for the <hi>Centurists</hi> as before; yet for my part I cannot but thinke, that as that learned Father relateth it, his ſilence was enforced. What hereout can you inferre? adoration of reliques? a notorious vanitie; O! you will argue <hi>à contrario</hi> thus; The Deuill was put to ſilence by the preſence of the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Babylas</hi> his bodie, <hi>ergo</hi> we may adore and

Chryſoſtome</hi> make this inference? no Sir, he referred all the glory to Chriſt, for whoſe teſtimonie hee ſuffred, and ſo doe wee. But ſhould wee according to your principles worſhip ſuch <hi>creatures, napkins, ſhadowes</hi> and <hi>bodies,</hi> by which God is pleaſed ſometimes to worke miracles, wee ſhould be turned from the Creator to the creature wee ſhould adore the Sunne and Moone, the Planets &amp;c. the which how heynous a ſinne it is, <hi>S.

                     <p>THE fourth reaſon is the impietie of this deuiſe, which I touched before. For this conceit doth much impaire both the loue of God in his ſeruants, and his feare in his enemies, ſeeing neither the one may expect from him miraculous helps, nor the other dread extraordinarie puniſhments: The Deuill only in this Age muſt rule the roſte, and be thought the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all wonders. If God, when Heretikes blaſpheme his Mother, and play with her noſe, ſtrike their tongues out of their heads, and their beſt noſes from their faces, hereſie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them to turne their hearts, that want tongues, and their faces without noſes against heauen, and call the Authour of that miracle Deuill. So that if Atheiſts can keep themſelues freinds with the Deuill, they need not by this doctrine greatly feare Gods miraculous power.</p>

                  <p>In this reaſonleſſe reaſon, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Flud</hi> taxeth our Church with impietie, for attributing the prodigies of their Synagogue to Satan. who would thinke then that this <hi>Sophy</hi> in this his reaſon ſhould incurre groſſe impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? His proofe that we commit impietie, hee frameth thus; Becauſe our imputing their prodigies to Satan
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17944:73"/> doth impaire Gods loue in his ſeruants, and feare in his enemies; doth make his prouidence to be defectiue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat neither one may expect miraculous helps, nor the other dread extraordinarie puniſhments; this is the ſubſtance of his triuiall proofe: which ended, hee runnes round and round about with his elegant skirmiſhes, hurting not ſo much as any mans noſe, but ſhewing the idleneſſe of his owne heart in ſo triuiall a pen.</p>
                  <p>He obiects impietie to vs, but I aduiſe him to looke vnto it that his proofes againſt vs fall not out to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous impieties. for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, is it not a point of high tempting impietie, to binde the hands of God to the ordinarie acting of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <note place="margin">

I thinke Sir, the holy Scriptures, which are <hi>(ratio omnis veritatis) the ground of all truth;</hi> and the Ancient Fathers doe teach it to be a point of tempting infidelitie, for any man to expect, as a neceſſarie office of Gods prouidence, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous helps or puniſhments? What was the Iſraelites <note place="margin">Exod 32.</note> ſinne in the deſert? was it not a murmuring for Gods ordinarie prouidence towards them, wherewith they were not contented, and their earneſt crauing and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſome miraculous helps? which their crauing and expecting, the holy Scriptures terme <hi>lust and concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> but your Ignatian Diuinitie, <hi>Chriſtian loue.</hi> This their luſtfull deſire God did heare, and granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, hee ſent them <hi>water out of the rock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thoſe bleſſed Martyrs of God caſt into the fiery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, were not acquainted with your Ignatian Diuinitie, <note place="margin">Dan: 3. 16. 17.</note> but the Tyrant was, who iumping in your doctrine, ſaid

                  <p>Their firſt head is, becauſe ſome Authours about thoſe times, and ſome preſently after, haue not related the ſame, <hi>ergo</hi> it was not ſo: What an idle <hi>ergo</hi> is this? what reaſon haue you to thinke, that all <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> were ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender of your <hi>Romane-darlinges</hi> credit, as to relate ſuch an eternall ignominie of their deare Mother?

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17944:86"/> of your deuoutes, that will commend to poſteritie their moſt helliſh attempts? the proceſſe made againſt the Traitours and the iuſt execution and iudgement of them?</p>
                  <p>By infinite like inſtances which might be produced it may eaſily appeare how idle the firſt ground of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments is. Some of the Hiſtorians <hi>Syn-Chroniſts</hi> of the ſame times with your <hi>Ioane,</hi> durſt not; moſt of them, out of a deare loue to your Darling would not doe it: and it is a petty wonder, that any one <hi>(veridicus) Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth</hi> could be found, who had the heart to commit to poſteritie, ſo infamous and prodigious a note of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie to your Church: and doubtleſſe both loue of truth, and euidence of truth perſwaded them to make publike ſo great a paradoxe as it might then ſeeme; and this I hold to be the reaſon why ſome of them relate it ſomewhat frearefully, and ſome of them would ſeeme willing to caſt ſome miſts of doubt vpon the tale, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſalue your vnerrable <hi>Sees</hi> ſore and wound, but it may not bee.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond generall defence, or head of arguments is; becauſe, ſome ſucceeding Popes, after this ſuppoſed <hi>Ioane,</hi> had very hatefull Aduerſaries in the Empire; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that none obiected the ſame to thoſe Popes. To this I anſwere, as Grammer Schoole Boies are wont to doe when their fellowes boult out any ſtollid and bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh arguments; <hi>Nunquam tam ſtolidum argumentum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diui, I neuer heard a more blockiſh reaſon.</hi> Sir, thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of your Popes, were enemies to their <hi>Perſons</hi> not to your <hi>Church;</hi> In the obiecting of this ignominie, they ſhould haue rather ſtained their Darling-mother-Church, then the Popes, and haue bewraied their owneneſt; what ſir? did thoſe Aduerſaries obiect all other criminous ignominies of precedent Popes ſuch as your ſelfe cannot denie? Had your <hi>Ioanes Child</hi> liued whereof ſhe was deliuered proceſſioning to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:17944:86"/> 
                     <hi>Lateranes;</hi> perhaps ſome might haue obiected to his confuſion ſo ſpurious a birth? or had your <hi>Ioane</hi> beene mounted to your See from out of ſome of the great Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Families; then ſome one might haue obiected the ſame to their ſhame; but as ſhe was deliuered of a ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous childe, ſo for any thing can be ſaid to the contrarie, ſhe was alſo a ſpurious <hi>Ioane</hi> her ſelfe: ſo that there was not any of her ſtocke, which might haue beene twitted with her ignominie; ſo that the diſcouering of the ſame by your owne Hiſtorians, ſhould haue brought no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profit to your Church, then ſhame, by reuealing their deare Mothers turpitude. Doth not your <hi>Bergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſis</hi> and ſome others relating the Hiſtory affirme, that in reſpect of the moſt ſhamefull turpitude of the tale, ſhe was not numbred in the Catalogue of your Popes, as <note place="margin">Pariſ lib. de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.

                  <p>A third ground of your defence is the impoſſibility or vnlikelihood of the tale, why vnlikely?

                  <p>The likelieſt matter to haue diſcouered her ſexe might haue beene want of a beard: but your Church had taken
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17944:87"/> order for that before, for your Maſſe-Prieſts and Monks vſed to be ſhauen.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Phyſicians will tell you, and that truly, that as there be waies to procure the growing of haire where nature had not determined the ſame, ſo likewiſe there are waies to hinder the growing of haire where nature had otherwiſe appointed it: whereof your Papiſſe <hi>Ioane</hi> being ſo ſingularly inſtructed in all humane literature could not be ignorant; and it is to be preſumed that ſhe hauing reſolued to liue in that ſort; ſhee vſed her moſt cunning meanes to conceale her ſexe, both to auoide pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to ſuch diſſembling being againſt the law of God; as alſo to purchaſe thoſe honours at which ſhe aimed; and which by her excellent learning ſhe knew ſhe was reputed and reported to haue deſerued. Adde to this, that there be women who by nature appeare <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbatae, halfe bearded,</hi> vpon whom the Italian prouer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth <hi>Da donna barbata í huomo raſo dio mi guarda, From a bearded woman, and a ſhauen man, God deliuer me.</hi> Why might not your <hi>Ioane</hi> be of ſome ſuch conſtitution? Why might not ſhe, beardleſſe by nature, liue in <hi>Rome</hi> amongſt breadleſſe by Arte; as well as ſome of your mincing women of late yeares, being of the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (pretending to be younger) paſſe the ſearches at our Portes and liue in <hi>Flaunders</hi> in the habit of men? as though they were men amongſt bearded men?

                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth ground of your reaſons, ariſeth out of ſome contrarieties which are in Authours, touching the time of this <hi>Ioanes</hi> ſitting. What of this? they are all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed, that ſhe ſate betwixt <hi>Lee</hi> the 4. and <hi>Benedict</hi> the 3. the yeere of our Lord 855. or 856. or the reabouts.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17944:87"/> Shall their varietie concerning the time of her Papacy ouerthrow the truth of the hiſtorie? beware of that: For how familiar a thing is it in your Hiſtorians and Crono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, to varie in the ſetting downe of the order and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of your Popes? ſhall ſuch variance make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doubtfull? if ſo; what then will become of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of your Rockes? whereon your Church is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? What will become of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> being and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Rome,</hi> (whereon your Papall ſupremacie is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) concerning which Authours are ſo diuers and ſo various? The <hi>Septuaginta-Tranſlatours</hi> Sir, and others, do they not differ in the account of the worlds age ſome hundreth of yeares? what ſhall we therefore play the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, and either deny <hi>Moſes</hi> credit, or the worldes creation?</p>
                  <p>Concerning the birth, life, and death of our Sauiour, is there no variance in <hi>Authours?</hi> ſhall wee therefore blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and call the truth of Chriſtianity in doubt?

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>The force of this your argument conſiſts in this, to wit, that the Deuills and Antichriſts miracles ſhall bee only wonderfull, and not <hi>profitable or beneficiall as yours are.</hi> But the edge of this your reaſon is made blunt by your <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> who in their Annotations vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note place="margin">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17944:94"/> Now if Antichriſt as they ſay ſhall bee powerfull in all manner of ſignes, why doth your Fatherhood to the aduantaging of his and your cauſe reſtraine his power to the working of ſome ſmall trifles. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> or the Authour vpon Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> is ſo <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Martyr ſhall ſubmit his body to torments; and yet before his eyes the very Executioner ſhall do ſignes: Whoſe inward vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may not then bee ſhaken, from the very bottome of his thoughts? whenas he, who tormenteth with ſtripes doth alſo ſhine with ſignes and wonders?</hi> Thus <hi>Gregorie,</hi> with much like matter, which might be produced; wherein hee is not diſſonant, from all the Ancients; according to that of Chriſt, that Antichriſt and his, ſhall do ſo many, and ſo great ſignes, that if it were poſſible the very elect ſhould be deceiued. But if Antichriſt and his, ſhall doe no ſignes profitable, the danger of the elect to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by them would not be ſo great, but ſeeing that <note place="margin">Math. 24. 24.</note> according to our Sauiours prediction the Deuills will labour by all meanes poſſible, by ſuch ſignes to deceiue

                  <p>Whereas you ſay, that it is blaſphemie to aſcribe to the Deuill your miracles, which are beneficiall both to body and ſoule; I cannot thinke but that your Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary reading the ſame, will ſmile at ſuch your vaine beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion.

                  <p>What manner of miracles Antichriſt and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall worke, the Scriptures with the Ancient Sages of the Church, haue ſufficiently declared vnto vs; It pleaſeth you following <hi>Bellarmines</hi> tracke, to caſt a miſt of errour before your Readers eyes, by putting him in minde of three kindes of miracles, which (as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt vainely) ſhall be proper to Antichriſt; euen
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17944:96"/> 4. <hi>modo;</hi> ſo that by them as by a ſpeciall badge hee may be knowne. The firſt miracle is that hee ſhall make the picture of a beaſt to ſpeake; Secondly, hee ſhall bring downe fire from heauen; Thirdly, hee ſhall faine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dead and riſe againe. To anſwere you and ſhew the moſt childiſh vanitie of your conceits.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, I challenge your fingers of leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine, for where (I beſeech you Sir) haue you read that Antichriſt ſhall make the picture of a beaſt to ſpeak? We read indeede, that the ſecond beaſt which roſe out of the earth, (by which all with one conſent vnderſtand Antichriſt as he pretendeth to be a ſpirituall Monarch) <hi>ſhall cauſe the inhahitants of the earth to make the image of the beaſt</hi> which aroſe out of the ſea, and which is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 14. 15 <hi>ibidem</hi> v. 2. 3.</note> in the beginning of the chapter to haue had ſeuen heades and tenne hornes, being in body like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> in feete like to a <hi>Beare,</hi> and in mouth like to a <hi>Lyon;</hi> and further that the ſaid ſecond Beaſt ſhould giue to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this firſt beaſt both life and ſpeach, and ſhould command all the inhabitants of the earth to adore the ſame. This being ſo, I doe now demand in good earneſt of your Fatherhood, of which of the Ancients haue you learned this your literall theologie, that there ſhould in very deed ariſe ſuch a beaſt, out of the Sea hauing ſeuen heades, tenne hornes, and in body, feete, mouth, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a Leoparde, a Beare, a Lion? Againe, of which of them haue you learned, that there ſhould ariſe a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leſſe beaſt out of the earth with two hornes (like vnto a lambe) vpon his head? which of the ancients euer taught you that ſuch two beaſts ſhould in ſuch ſhapes &amp; and formes ſucceede each other, and in the ſame ſhapes and formes be adored, and worſhipped by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth? Sir, bethinke your ſelfe, what time the inhabitants of the earth ſhall haue to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the place where this picture ſhal be erected, that they may come and worſhippe the ſame? A Iubily of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17944:96"/> three yeares and a halfe will hardly ſerue the turne: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, bethink your ſelfe how great this picture ſhall be, which the Inhabitants of the earth ſhall bee cauſed to make, greater ſurely then the cabbage, for ſeething of which (as the idle fable goes) a 1000. workmen were a whole yeare in prouiding a caldron. Bethinke your <note place="margin">The Papiſts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall diuinitie touching the Beaſts Image.</note> ſelfe what adoe there will bee to raiſe vp and ſet vp this picture, greater doubtleſſe, then your Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5. had, to reare his Pyramis before Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome.</hi> Bethinke your ſelfe how the deuout feminine <hi>ſexe</hi> will dare to appeare before a God of ſo monſtrous, ſo fearefull ſhape. Bethinke your ſelfe how many ſheep lambes &amp;c. are to bee prouided for a <hi>Bell</hi> that hath ſo many mouthes. Conſider how the elect may be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſeduced by ſuch abominable Idolatrie, which the very ſenſe of men will ſeeme to deteſt? Idolatrie more vaine then that of the <hi>Calecutians,</hi> which adore their God in the ſhape and forme of a Cat, and equall with that by which they adore and worſhip the Deuill in a moſt horrible dreadfull ſhape.</p>
                  <p>Anſwere ſir I pray you; you and yours, which talke <note place="margin">Ignatians moſt fond in their literall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the two beaſts, they regard not what they either ſay or write ſo they may cleare their holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichriſt.</note> ſo much of the madneſſe of others may it not iuſtly bee replied vnto you. <hi>Inſanitis ſi ita dicatis, you are madde if you ſo vnderſtand</hi> the Euangeliſt and Prophet, that ſuch beaſts ſhall ariſe in the very property of forme and ſhape as the Prophet doth deſcribe them and rule the world. What then elſe are theſe Beaſts thus ariſing, but types, ſignes, and formes repreſenting two different Empires, rules, or formes of gouernment, each ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other? What elſe doth the beaſt ariſing out of the earth portend by his lambe-like hornes but Antichriſt, who pretending the lambes power <hi>(that lambes which taketh away the ſinnes of the world &amp;c.)</hi> ſhall ſet vp a forme of gouernment; which ſhall not be the ſame of the firſt beaſt; but an Image-repreſentation of the ſame; one in manner, forme, and effect like vnto the firſt? To this

Perhaps you thought not of it, or elſe you were willing to paſſe by it, to wit, that Antichriſt ſhould giue life to the Image (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh) of the Beaſt; and this, becauſe your Crucifixes, which haue vſed to ſpeake and nod to your Saints had not life in them; but why did you not call to minde the <hi>Cherubicall</hi> Angell, which in the forme of a <hi>Crucifixe,</hi> ſpoke to Saint <hi>Francis?</hi> or why did you not thinke of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Wolfe</hi> at <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubium,</hi> with whom your Saint made ſo long a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? or why did you forget Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Satyre which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh Maſter <hi>Floode</hi> what a gallant Giant-like monſter god befitting Antichriſts idolatrie, would the Image of the beaſt (ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Sea) be, if beſides ſpeach which you &amp; yours giue him, he might alſo haue life giuen vnto him as the Prophet ſpeaketh; that ſo hee might walke and ſtalke vp and downe, and ſit in his throne of Maieſtie; he would ſurely put downe your Saint <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> were

But I let paſſe to ſpeake any more of this miracle; I haſten to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yet I muſt not forget to tell you of your tricke of legerdemaine; when you put in this place, picture for image; the fraud is peculiarly yours, you could not bee ignorant that in our common vſe of ſpeech, the word <hi>Image</hi> is, and may be taken for any manner of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of another thing; but the acception of picture is more ſtrict, euer ſignifiing a repreſentation made by the Painter or Drawer. Your fraud was to deceiue your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to make him thinke of ſome picture or Statue &amp; to cauſe him to miſtake the Prophet when he ſaith, that the ſecond beaſt ſhall cauſe the Image of the firſt to ſpeake.

Sir, our faith is ſo clothed (I ſpeake not of the Preciſians and Sectaries, neither of thoſe that are <hi>in aperto</hi> or in ſecret ſuch,) with good workes, that I dare boldlie ſay ſtanding within the limits of modeſtie, manie of our men are in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree inferior to yours: I doe ſuppoſe verilie ſir, that if his moſt excellent Maieſtie ſhould offer for one Church and Miniſter permitted in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>Millain,</hi> or <hi>Madrid,</hi> to permit two, both Churches and Prieſts in his City of London; your holie Father and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh monarch would not, nor durſt not admit of the ſame.

                  <p>For further clearing of this point, I deſire the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader to conſider with me, how that the Ignatian and Popiſh Preachers, doe at the firſt of their preaching endeauour, or ſeeme to endeauour to laie for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and firſt corner ſtone Chriſt Ieſus, whom they teach and proach to be the onlie Meſſias, and that by faith in him, and true repentance; with obſeruation of his commandements, ſaluation is onlie to be purchaſed; and vpon this ground worke they endeauour to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all contrarie worſhips of Iewes, Infidels, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; And ſo long as they reſt here, their manner of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is Chriſtian and Apoſtolicall, for confirmation of which preaching to the Pagans, if God be pleaſed to ſhew ſome miracles, it is not much to be maruelled at: But hauing by ſuch manner of preaching conuerted ſome to be chriſtians, then they deliuer their owne Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments to this foundation; not of <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> but of brambles and bryers, then talke they of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, praying to Saints, Popes ſupremacie, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, with a thouſand vanities; and that we may better conceiue this their practice with the Infidels, I will in ſome inſtances ſhew their manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p> When they aſſault anie they doe not at firſt inuite them to adoration and worſhipping of Images, or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Croſſe; nay rather if occaſion of ſpeech of them be offered, they will profeſſe and proteſt, that they <note place="margin">The ſhe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vſed by Popiſh Prieſts to make their new Proſelytes</note> doe not adore them, but that they haue them onlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in their <hi>Oratories</hi> and Churches, as memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls and remembrances of Chriſt and his Saints; but being fullie conuerted, then they impart vnto them the myſterie of adoration of Images; yet in nice termes, at firſt, to wit, that they adore and worſhip them not for themſelue, but for God and the Saints whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent.

                  <p>Whereas you talke of ſitting by the fire, or ſleeping in warme beds, I dare boldly ſay, number for number; the ſame is more practiſed by your Prieſts and Ignatians, then by our Miniſters, except ſome few diſordered ones;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17944:110"/> the reaſon whereof firſt is, their neuer intermitted dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in preaching, which cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtudie and labour, whereas few of yours take care for Sermons; their ordinarie taskes being to heare ſome pretty tales at confeſſions, to mumble vp their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and to ſay their Maſſes.

Such ſubiects as are by oath for confirmation of their fidelitie further bound to their Soueraignes, if the ſaid Soueraignes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be excommunicate and denounced by the Pope (as it hath hapned in this Kingdome) the queſtion is, whether ſuch Subiects ſhall need a very relaxation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from ſuch their oathes, or rather only a declaration, that ſuch their oathes binde not, the matter of their oathes being changed, to wit, they that were Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes before, being how none; their Soueraignties being taken from them, by vertue of their Popes denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatiue excommunication or depoſition.

And here I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer an obiection by the way which may be thus made:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17944:117"/> By our firſt vowe in Baptiſme we are bound to keepe all after promiſes or vowes; which we may make either to God or man. It is true indeede, in ſuch vowes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that are iuſt, and in ſuch things that a man hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to vow; now in caſe a man or a woman cannot containe or hath not the gift of chaſtitie (which is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they haue not if they doe not containe) then they <note place="margin">It is impoſſible for him to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine who hath not the gift of continency</note> haue not libertie to vowe; for in ſuch caſes the law of God preſcribeth and commandeth marriage; reiecting ſuch ſinfull vowes which the votaries cannot obſerue, but are by them more and more enthralled in the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>If they reply and ſay, it was indeed in the votaries free choice, whether he would vowe or not; but hauing vowed, he is abſolutely tied to the performance of the ſame, and is no more at his owne libertie: I anſwer thus cleerlie, and returne the argument againſt themſelues: If there may be no error in vowing, then downe falleth <note place="margin">My faculty for diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. was deliuered in theſe words. <hi>Facultas, &amp;c.</hi> A faculty to diſpenſe with all vowes and oathes; excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe of perpetuall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If our Pontificians could ſhew vs out of the word of God, that a promiſcuous and indifferent liberty of vowing chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were allowable in all ſorts of people, then they ſhould ſay ſomewhat to that purpoſe; but concerning this we may take a ſcantling out of that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ordereth touching yonger widdowes: (which all the aduerſaries generally vnderſtand of vowing <hi>Nunnes)</hi> that they are not in any caſe to bee accepted or admitted <hi>before they be threeſcore yeereold,</hi> (a competent and ſufficient time for triall and probation) wholly to dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God by renouncing of the world. O M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Flud</hi> what defence can you make for your Churches admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Boyes, and Girles, to vowe before they come to

He will haue none admitted before they be threeſcore yeere old, and after long triall; you admit yong girles of fourteene yeeres of age, and are not aſhamed to permit them to profeſſe after a yeeres probation; yea more then this, (for the conſummating of your impietie in this kinde) though ſuch yonger probationers in the yeere of their tryall doe finde themſelues continuallie buffeted with temptations on all ſides; yea and oftentime to be moſt vnconſolablie afflicted, yet rather then ſuch ſhall depart from you, if they may proue beneficiall to your Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, or at leaſt for auoiding of ſcandall, they ſhall haue ſtrange incouragements giuen them, to continue in that wicked courſe, whereby their Soules are very likelie eternallie to periſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, out of the ninth ſuppoſition, I euidentlie <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Inſerence. </seg>Fourth</label> deduce; if it be lawfull for one who hath vowed to enter into ſome one religion, not to ſtand to the keeping of his vowe, if in time of his triall and probation he finde not himſelfe fit for the ſame: Why then ſhall it not be lawfull for any Monke, Frier, Prieſt, or Nunne, after they haue made their vowes, if they by experience find themſelues altogether vnfit, and that they were both in time of their probation, and at the time of their vowing deceiued by ſome deluſion; why (I ſay) ſhall it not be lawfull for them to vſe ſuch remedies againſt thoſe temptations as God hath appointed?</p>
                  <p>Standing within the obligation and nature of a vowe, what difference can be found betwixt that which is ſimple, and that which is ſolemn?

                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:17944:119"/> minde (the Doctour was then in a place of great note) that whereas before, he was doubtfull whether to marry or not; he reſolued fully to make vſe of his Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; and to enter into that courſe of life; being not a little ſcandalized at the Doctours aduiſe, as in like ſort another Prieſt, was at the cenſure of ſome other, who greatly reprooued him for that euen at the ſame time, when he was conuerted, hee entered into the holy ſtate of matrimonie.</p>
                  <p>Further to touch ſome other ſpeciall ends, &amp; motiues, which moue your religious to vow; they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vaine and ſuperſtitious: the ſuperſtition of which being opened vnto them, the inualidity of their vowes is thereby alſo opened; ſo that they may for ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ends, as to make vſe of their chriſtian liberty, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create children, to ſhake off Antichriſts yoke, &amp;c. law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and freely enter into the ſtate of matrimonie.</p>
                  <p>How idle an end is that, whereby you make a ſingle life to be more ſatisfactorious for ſinnes, then the other?</p>
                  <p>How vaine that, that no man entring into the eſtate of marriage, can ſo carefully looke to the charge of ſoules as thoſe which are vnmarried?</p>
                  <p>How pernicious an end is that, and moſt iniurious to Chriſts death and paſſion? (which is indeed the cheifeſt end, all your votaries aime at) by which you teach them, that by meanes of a ſolemne profeſſion of your vowes; they are made as cleare and free from all their ſinnes, as the childe or Adult Perſon which is preſently taken <note place="margin">See <hi>Azor: inſtit. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> from the font of Baptiſme. This is a high point of your ſuperſtition, to equalize your ſolemne vowe-profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the Sacrament of Baptiſme. Yea ſome of your Doctours grant that, to this your owne pretended tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolemne vowing, which they denie to baptiſme; to wit, that ſo often as a profeſſed Perſon ſhall renew in his or her minde their former profeſſion ratifying and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17944:119"/> approuing the ſame, they are thereby anew expiated, and made cleare from all their ſinnes; ſo potent a lauer, and ſacrament it is. By the which it is moſt cleare, that all your profeſſours haue their vowes grounded vpon moſt ſuperſtitious ends.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now make application to ſome of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially your Nunnes. The Apoſtle decreeth, that <hi>younger women and widowes ſhould marrie,</hi> and that the <note place="margin">

This is the Apoſtles ſpeciall decree; wiſely weighing how rare the gift of continencie is, eſpecially to widowes. Compare now this together with your preſumptuous doctrine, who to draw young boyes and girles to make profeſſion of chaſtitie, before they can conceiue what chaſtitie is, yea to make profeſſion of chaſtitie, when as ſome of them, know themſelues to be luxuriouſly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte; doe gilde ouer your Vowes of profeſſion, with ſuch incomparable perfection, that you equalize it with Baptiſme. But this your end being ſo pernicious; the motiues and inducements ſo ſuperſtitious, who can doubt, but ſuch (to whom God ſhall be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale his truth) as haue made in your Church ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vowes, but that they are as free from them, and the <note place="margin">All your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors confeſſe <hi>vna voce,</hi> that vowes made for a ſinfull end are not to be kept.</note> obligation of them before God, as if they had neuer made them? for they are <hi>(ipſo iure, iure diuino nullae) euen by Gods owne law,</hi> of no force and validitie, and ſo in all lawes ought to be <hi>(nullae)</hi> voide and none, and of no force.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, out of the twelfth Suppoſition I euidently <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Infe∣rence. </seg>Sixth</label> inferre, that ſuch as haue not the efficacious and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gift of continencie, they are in the caſe of impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; and ſo conſequently, are no more bound to keepe ſuch Vowes, then thoſe who haue made Vowes of things apparantly impoſſible; whether naturally or morally
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17944:120"/> impoſſible, it little mattereth: as alſo it is no matter whether the impoſſibilitie be apparant or not; it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that the conſcience of the Votarie, telleth him, by his often conflicts, falls and foyles, that he hath not the gift of continencie. Neither ſhall it helpe you to anſwer and ſay, that ſuch haue the gift of continencie, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote power, poſſibilitie, or ſufficiencie, to be able to keepe it, though infallibly they ſhall neuer therby actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and effectually keep it: for this your anſwer beſides that it is blaſphemous againſt the goodneſſe and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, ſo it is alſo idle in it ſelfe. For, what would you thinke of that man, who ſhould make a Clocke, with wheeles, barres, hammer, bell, hand, and all other parts and inſtruments belonging to the ſame, and yet hee ſhould ſo place and order them together, that they ſhould infallibly neuer ſtrike? would you thinke him wiſe, if hee ſhould ſay he had made a Clock, which had a <hi>poſſe,</hi> a ſufficient ableneſſe to ſtrike, though infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly it ſhould neuer ſtrike, as being diſorderly placed? Or what would you thinke of ſuch a ones wiſdome, if he ſhould be offended, that the Clocke did neuer ſtrike? Make you application <hi>Mr. Flud,</hi> and ſee how blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly you ſpeake, and write of God. He giueth, (for ſo you all generally teach) to all Monkes, Prieſts and Nunnes, ſuch ſufficiencie of grace, whereby they may be able to conteyne, yet he ſo proffereth theſe his graces, in ſuch circumſtances of time, in ſuch condition of place, or in ſuch proportion to others, or in ſuch diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the bodie or minde of them, to whom the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are proffered, that infallibly they ſhall not, nor will not effectually and actually conteyne therewith, no not one of all them, to whom grace onely ſufficient is offered.</p>
                  <p>Againe; what would you thinke of the wiſdome, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and goodneſſe of that Magiſtrate, which ſhould commaund ſome Citizen, to a needleſſe peece of worke?
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17944:120"/> for example, to goe and keepe ſentinell in a time of no danger, and ſhould for that purpoſe, furniſh him with Musket, and all other things belonging to that charge; yet ſhould keepe his doores ſhut vp ſo faſt, that the poore Citizen could not poſſibly ſtirre abroad. Would you commend his wiſdome, goodneſſe or iuſtice, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee ſhould tell the Citizen, that hee gaue him a Musket &amp;c. wherewith to keepe ſentinell? he gaue him a ſufficiencie to doe it, and therefore becauſe he did not effectually and actually performe ſo much, hee ſhall be puniſhed for ſo treaſonable an offence? make you the application <hi>Mr. Flud.</hi> God giues all your Votaries a remote ſufficiencie, and power, to be able to conteyne, and yet doth not ſo congruouſly, and effectually moue and excite them, that they ſhall and will actually and really conteyne; and yet hee damneth them to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting puniſhment, becauſe they doe not actually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conteyne, which they neuer can doe without his efficacious grace, which notwitſtanding hee denieth vnto them. I tell you <hi>Mr. Flud,</hi> that though the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of heauen were opened to ſhowre downe graces vpon your Votaries, yet if God by his ſpeciall hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually excite not their wills and mindes, to make vſe, and to take hold of ſuch graces, they are like vnto the Citizen which is commanded to keepe Sentinell, and yet hath his dores ſo ſhut vpon him, that he cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſtirre abroad. Perhaps you will anſwer, that when the graces be offered and proffered, the will is able to make vſe of them, and by them actually to conteyne; beware of that <hi>Mr. Flud,</hi> for it is deepe Pelagianiſme ſo to affirme; and to make the vſe and application of grace to be from mans will, and not effectually and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly from grace it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, out of the thirteenth Suppoſition I eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <note place="margin">Seuenth Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> inferre; that ſeeing all are ſeruants to Chriſt, and vnder his obedience, it cannot be, that any may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17944:121"/> to vow any thing, which is againſt his command, Now his command is <hi>rather to marrie then to burne:</hi> his expreſſe precept is that thoſe <hi>which conteyne not muſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> and that onely thoſe are to conteyne, which haue the gift thereof. But hee who findeth by a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued experience that hee can not get it (as an infinitie of your <hi>Priests, Fryers</hi> and <hi>Nunnes,</hi> doe) ſuch a one doubtleſſe is to looke vpon Gods expreſſe command; and not to tye himſelfe with any priuate law of Vow, for performance of that, for which he wanteth ſtrength and abilitie.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, out of the foureteenth ſuppoſition, I do moſt clearely inferre, that all ſuch, who at the taking of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">Eight Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> in the Papall Church, doe vow with their mouthes onely, and haue no intention to binde themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; that all ſuch are free from keeping of ſuch verball promiſes; howſoeuer whileſt they liue in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they ſhall be compelled to the keeping of the ſame. Now that many ſo doe in that Church, it may eaſily be ſuppoſed, conſidering the frequencie of their doctrine and practiſe of equiuocation; eſpecially in the point when violence is offered againſt a mans libertie; or elſe <note place="margin">See Azor.</note> an vniuſt queſtion is propoſed to be anſwered, as in this caſe both doe happen. This being ſo; all thoſe, who haue ſo deceiued by their owne arte, the Pope and his Officers, are doubtleſſe no more tyed to ſingle life, then any other thing, whereof they neuer made any promiſe or vowe at all. And in the Reformed Churches, if any ſhould diſrepute a Conuert for marrying vpon or after his conuerſion, ſuch a one ſheweth himſelfe either to be a politike Chriſtian, or an vnconſtant Neutrall. Gods cauſe needs no vnchriſtian policie, to bolſter vp the ſame. If it be ſaid that the Papiſts are ſcandalized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; alac, what is there in the reformed Churches wherewith they are not ſcandalized? But wee muſt ſay of them as Chriſt ſaid of the Scribes and Phariſies, <hi>Coeci</hi>

                     <hi>ſunt &amp; duces coecorum;</hi> and ſo I end this diſcourſe with thoſe two excellent axiomes of Law, <hi>Turpevotum quod ſcelere impletur.

                  <p>Thus <hi>Mr. Flud</hi> I haue cleared out of your owne principles the lawfulneſſe of mariage in your Votaries; if occaſion doe require it, I doubt not but that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>analogie</hi> of faith, I ſhall be able to defend theſe, to ſtrengthen and enlarge them.

                  <p>After you haue generally twitted the reformed Churches for receiuing of Monkes and Fryers, then you begin particularly to diſpute thus grauely againſt <hi>Martin Luther.

                  <hi>Certaine reaſons ſhewing Popiſh miracles to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAuing thus ſhewed the imbecillitie of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I referre what I haue done to the iudicious Reader. Yet for further confirmation of the Truth, I will by Gods aſſiſtance, adde certaine reaſons out of holy Scripture, to proue the very contradictorie of your propoſition, to wit, that your Popiſh miracles are no other then Antichriſts lying wonders. But before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer my reaſons, I am to prefixe ſome few Suppoſitions, which our Aduerſaries themſelues cannot denie.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe firſt that the fureſt and certaineſt way, to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Suppoſ. </seg>1</label>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:17944:129"/> finde out the nature of Antichriſtian miracles, is to ſearch the Scriptures, and there to examine what thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and properties are, which they doe faſten and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the miracles of Antichriſt and his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſuppoſe, that in moſt places of holy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Suppoſ. </seg>2</label> Scripture, where any mention either expreſſe or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite is made of Antichriſt or his Miniſters, and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the ſpecialties and ſpeciall kindes of ſuch miracles, are no where ſo ſpecified as in the Reuelation; ſo that what we may learne of them in other places and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scripture, muſt be <hi>(ex adiunctis)</hi> by circumſtance of the places, and context of Scripture, in which the miracles of Antichriſt and his, are in generall termes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſuppoſe, out of the conſent of all, whether <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Suppoſ. </seg>3</label> ancient or moderne, that the Apocalypſe is a booke wholy myſticall, which doth (excepting ſome few do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall rules and exhortations to virtue) in types, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, formes, and reſemblances, deſcribe and foretell the future euents of the Church. Now the nature of theſe typicall and figuratiue prophecies is ſuch, before they are fulfilled and accompliſhed, that no man can tell well without ſpeciall reuelation, what to make of them; or how out of them to draw any firme or ſolid argument; but the ſame being accompliſhed, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it ſelfe vnto the ſerious meditator, ſuch a clearnes of truth, that out of them not only coniecturall, but euen neceſſarie arguments may be gathered for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe fourthly, that in the very obſcureſt paſſages <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Suppoſ. </seg>4</label> of that hidden booke, if it happen (as it often doth) that the vnderſtanding of ſome principall part thereof, is made cleare, by reaſon that ſome part of the Viſion is accompliſhed and fulfilled; then the other parts and adiuncts of that Viſion, are to be interpreted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed by the ſame, prouided, that he who expoundeth,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17944:129"/> hath a carefull eye to other parts of Scripture, and the analogie of faith; as alſo to examine carefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, the autenticall Hiſtories of thoſe times, in which the principall part of the viſion is accompliſhed. As for example, in the thirteenth of the Reuelation, we haue the ariſing vp of two beaſts deſcribed; The firſt out of the Sea, with diuers heads and hornes and Diademes vpon the ſame: The ſecond out of the Earth, hauing two hores like the Lambe, with other particulars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing him to be rather a pretended ſpirituall Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than a Temporall Monarch. Now wee haue in <note place="margin">Apoc: 13. 12, 14, 15.</note> this ſame 13. Chapter in the 12 and other verſes, it moſt clearely deſcribed, that this ſecond Beaſt is ſo linked, and ioyned to the firſt, that they ſeeme both to make but one totall, compleat and monarchicall Gouernment, the one being ſubſidiarie and helping to the other: and this is deliuered by moſt of the Pontificians, who will haue Antichriſt himſelfe to be ſignified by the firſt, by the other, either a multitude of his falſe Prophets, or elſe ſome one moſt notorious and immediate Precurſor of his, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iega</hi> with diuers others. By which it is moſt <note place="margin">Viega in Apoc.</note> cleare, euen by the confeſſion of the Aduerſaries, that by theſe two Beaſts, is ſignified, the whole Antichriſtian Gouernment, both in head and members, which alſo ſeemeth to be deliuered by the Prophet himſelfe; who <note place="margin">Apoc: 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> declaring how the Beaſt was deſcribed by the Angell that appeared vnto him, maketh mention of one onely Beaſt, including and conteyning the latter in the former. Now that we may come to know, what manner of falſe Prophet, or falſe Prophets are ſignified by the ſecond Beaſt, working miracles and prodigies, for the ſeruice of the firſt Beaſt; wee are to ſearch what manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, Rule, and Monarchie; and where, in what place, and what time is ſignified by the firſt, that had heads and Diademes vpon it: the which wee may very eaſily performe, ſeeing it pleaſed God by his Angell, to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17944:130"/> interpret the ſame vnto his Prophet <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> By whoſe interpretation, together with that which Pontificians themſelues doe deliuer, wee may eaſily come to know what Gouernment or Monarchie is deſcribed by the firſt: which being knowne, the vnderſtanding of the other will be facill and eaſie; the examining of which, I refer till anon. Theſe things thus ſuppoſed, I come to my reaſons, which I ground vpon three ſeuerall heads or foundations.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be out of the very ſpecialties of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts miracles, deſcribed in <hi>S. Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond head ſhall be out of certaine qualities and conditions, which the holy Scriptures doe faſten vpon Antichriſtian miracles.</p>
               <p>The third ſhall be out of ſome cleare circumſtances of holy Scripture, by which we are pointed both to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his miracles; which performed, the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader may not expect more in this place concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this argument; and withall hee may vnderſtand that wee are not chiefly to proue the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chriſt by his miracles, but that truth being otherwiſe euicted and convinced, wee confirme the ſame poſition by the Antichriſtianiſme of his miracles.</p>
               <p>I might adde a fourth head of ſuch places as point vs to Antichriſt, but make no mention of his miracles; but of them hereafter if occaſion require, ſome of them I haue examined in my firſt Prelude.</p>
               <p>Out of the firſt ground, thus I argue. <note place="margin">Firſt reaſon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer in himſelfe, and in his Miniſters hath done thoſe ſpeciall miracles, which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> deſcribeth in the thirteenth Chapter of his Prophecie, hee hath in himſelfe and in his Miniſters done Antichriſtian mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. But the Pope of Rome, both in himſelfe and in his Miniſters hath done thoſe miracles deſcribed by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">verſes 13. 15.</note> in the 13 of his Prophecie, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope of Rome in himſelfe, and in his miniſters hath done Antichriſtian Miracles.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:17944:130"/>
               <p> The <hi>Maior</hi> or firſt propoſition, I ſuppoſe as manifeſt, confeſſed by all, gaineſaid by none.</p>
               <p>The ſecond or <hi>Minor,</hi> thus I proue.</p>
               <p>The miracles deſcribed by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the 13 chapter of his Prophecie, and in the 13 and 15 verſes, are two. The one, to make fire to come downe from heauen vpon earth, in the ſight of men. The other, that hee ſhould giue life to the Image of the Beaſt, ſo that the Beaſt ſhould ſpeake: But the Pope of Rome and his, haue done theſe two, <hi>Ergo.</hi> That the Pope and his, haue done theſe two, thus I make it manifeſt. And to begin with the firſt, which is to make fire to come downe from heauen vpon earth, in the ſight of men. If wee vnderſtand this according to the plaine ſenſe of the wordes (as probably wee muſt) like as <hi>Elias</hi> cauſed fire <note place="margin">1 Reg: 18. 38. 2 Reg: 1. 12.</note> to come downe from heauen, againſt the falſe Prophets; vpon and againſt the fiftie ſeruants; then cleare it is, that the Pope and his, haue cauſed fire to come from heauen. For what elſe then fire from heauen, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Pope making tryall of the Archbiſhop of Rauennas Caution at <hi>S. Peters</hi> memorie, the ſame was ſcorched and made as blacke as a burnt cole?</p>
               <p>What other then fire from heauen, were thoſe torches which gaue light from out of the clouds to <hi>Zacharie</hi> Pope as he iourneyed to Rauenna?</p>
               <p>What elſe then fire from heauen was that which burnt <note place="margin">

               <p>What elſe then fire from heauen, when as to ſhew the force of Excommunication, bread hath been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and therevpon ſcorched and made blacke as a dead burnt cole, as we may read in your <hi>Speculo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorum?</hi> What other then fire from heauen, was and is the miraculous Arras Candle? What elſe then fire from heauen, was that ſplendent light (like vnto that of

               <p>What other then fire from heauen; when your Saint <hi>Edmunds</hi> candle was ſo ſtrangely lighted by his prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi>
               </p>

What other then ſuch a myſticall fire from heauen, is their thunderbolt of excommunication? by which they dethrone and caſt down euen to hell, whom they pleaſe? What elſe then myſticall fire from heauen, are thoſe graces and bleſſings which the Pope, yea euery Prieſt can fetch from heauen, by ſaying certaine prayers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Oratio ad bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d cendum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque.</note> in your Ritualls? yea they are ſo powerfull, that they can call downe, and pray downe the Graces and preſence of the holy Ghoſt vpon what Creatures ſoeuer they ſhall pleaſe: witneſſe your Pontificall and Rituall bookes.</p>
               <p>Theſe things which I haue here deliuered are very true, and you cannot deny them, out of which it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by moſt cleare conſequence, that in the ſight and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the men of your Church, the Pope and his, doe make fire come from heauen, whether wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame myſticallie or literally; and ſo wee ſee the firſt Antichriſtian miracle accompliſhed in your Church. Now to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Before I declare my ſecond argument, I note that the Prophet himſelfe, doth not call Antichriſts making the image of the beaſt to ſpeake, either a miracle, or a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17944:132"/> wonder, neither doe I thinke it is to be eſteemed as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in ſtrict termes, and ſtrict manner of ſpeaking; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we may call it a morall miracle, that is a miraculous effecting of that, which was morally impoſſibly by wonderfull reſtoring of a collapſed and decayed eſtate, but ſpeaking of the ſame as moſt doe wee will call it a miracle.</p>
               <p>This Antichriſtian miracle then, is deſcribed by the Prophet in the fifteenth verſe thus, to wit; <hi>that hee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall giue life or breath to the Image of the Beaſt; ſo that the Image of the Beaſt, ſhould ſpeake, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhippe the Image of the beaſt ſhould bee killed.</hi> Here the Pontificians eſpecially their great <hi>Auguſtine Bellarmine,</hi> do triumphantly inferre, that ſeeing neuer any Pope did make any Image of a Beaſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. lib. de. Pont.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> to ſpeake; or propoſe any ſuch Image to be worſhipped, that conſequently their Pope cannot be Antichriſt. But weighing this their triumphant inference (before the victorie) I cannot but exclaime and call the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens to witneſſe againſt their wilfull obſtinacie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie herein, who here will reſt and inſiſt vpon the plaine and literall ſenſe of the wordes, vnderſtanding them as they ſound, whereas the whole context of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, together with their owne principles muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie enforce them, to ſome myſticall and figuratiue interpretation of the wordes: for to diſpute out of their owne groundes, muſt not the Image of the beaſt be the ſame (at leaſt <hi>genere in</hi> kinde) in ſhew, reſemblance, and repreſentation, which the beaſt it ſelfe is in veritie and truth of the thing? Now is it not a confeſſed truth by themſelues, (clearely alſo to be euinced out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that by the beaſt, with ſo many heades and hornes, with Diademes vpon them, are ſignified ſome manners of State, Rule, Gouernment or Monarchie? if ſo; then moſt aſſuredly, the Image repreſentatiue, and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of ſuch a beaſt, muſt bee ſome ſtate, gouernment,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17944:132"/> Empire or Monarchie, in ſemblance and ſhew repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame: to ſay that the Image ſhould be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue, in the nature of other Pictures, or ſtatues, ſuch as hange vpon walls, or are placed in publike places, is meerely a vanitie. How improbable and morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the whole world ſhould be brought to adore a picture of ſuch a beaſt, whether it be maſſie of ſiluer and gold, or drawne in collours? Conſider Maſter <hi>Floode,</hi> the forme of ſuch an Image, it muſt bee made with ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heades, tenne hornes, with Diademes vpon them; <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 1. 2. 3</note> in the forehead muſt be written the name of blaſphemy; in body it muſt be like a Leopard, in feet like to a beare, in mouth ſhewing a Lyon; this is the goodly Image af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the whole world muſt wonder, and which it muſt adore; for the holy Ghoſt ſaith expreſſely, that he who maketh this image, will cauſe and compell the firſt Beaſt to be worſhipped, <hi>and an image of the Beaſt which was wounded to be made and to be worſhipped.</hi> Now moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident it is, that the firſt beaſt whereof the image is to be made, is of this and more monſtrous proportion, then I haue deſcribed. Further (to ſpeake according to their owne principles) is it not a likely thing, that Antichriſt who (as they ſay) ſhall be an vtter enemie to all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, who ſhall worſhip no God publikely, ſaue only the God <hi>Maozim</hi> in ſecret; that he ſhould ſet vp, ſo ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo ill ſhaped, and ſo monſtrous an <hi>Image,</hi> compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all to worſhip the ſame? and the Refuſers thereof, to be ſlaine? is this agreeing to your owne principles M. <hi>Floode,</hi> or is it likely to agree with Antichriſts pollicie, pride, hipocriſie? fie fie vpon ſuch fictions.</p>
               <p>Further, if this be to be vnderſtood literallie of the making of ſome image repreſenting the firſt beaſt, a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, Lyon, and Beare, why then doth the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet with two hornes, cauſe the inhabitants of the earth (meaning all vnder his obeiſance) to make the ſame? why rather doth he not require <hi>Image-makers, Painters,</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:17944:133"/> or <hi>Statuaeries?</hi> belike the Image was ſo maſſie and huge, greater then that of <hi>Nebuchodonozor,</hi> ſo that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> of the earth muſt be required to make the ſame; And if it be ſo maſſie, yea if it be a materiall Image, how is it poſſible, it ſhould be carried vp and down from one Kingdome to another; ſo that in three years and a halfe, the whole world may worſhip the ſame? If it be to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, Maſter <hi>Flood,</hi> prophecie vnto vs the manner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like your <hi>Pope</hi> vpon mens ſhoulders, or like your <hi>Loretto</hi> goddeſſe, tranſported miraculouſlie by the hands of Angells. Perhaps you will anſwer and ſay, that though the <hi>Maſſic-image</hi> or principall picture it ſelfe, be reared vp in one place, yet the Inhabitants of the earth ſhall be enforced euery one of them, to haue ſome pretty Images, and repreſentations of the ſame. Be it as it will, I pray you to reſt merry with your conceit of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Image, for my part I profeſſe ingenuouſly I am tyred to be put to diſpute againſt theſe your vanities.</p>
               <p>The true meaning therefore of this place is thus; to wit that the ſecond Beaſt which hath two hornes like the Lambe, that is pretendeth by a two-fold power of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <note place="margin">Claues Poteſtatis &amp; S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now it reſteth to be proued whether the Popes haue done this or not: the which becauſe it is a point manifeſt, and <hi>(in confeſſo)</hi> confeſſed I will diſpatch it in a word or two. What the Image-ſtate, or Image-Empire is, we ſhall eaſilie know if we can firſt find what the firſt State and Monarchie was, ſignified by the firſt Beaſt, ariſing out of the ſea: the nature and property whereof it pleaſed the Angell to declare to <hi>S.

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider vnto what ſhifts the Pontificians are here put, it would make the Sumners Aſſe to breake his halter; ſome of them ſay, that by theſe fiue Kings are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thoſe fiue Romane Emperors, who after <hi>Nero</hi> held the Empire to wit <hi>Veſpaſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Titus, Galba, Otho, Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> by the one that was when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, <hi>Domitian,</hi> by him that was to come ſhortly after, and to continue but a ſhort time, <hi>Nerua Traiaenus.</hi> The vanity of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit needeth no refutation; <hi>Viegas</hi> relateth it as the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Victorinus</hi> and vtterly reiecteth it; yet himſelfe, as

I will not looſe time to diſpute againſt this their idle conceit, common amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot (wiſhing my pen were able as a trumpet to ſound in the eares of all Chriſtians) but obſerue, how <hi>Viegas</hi> the grand Ignatian, commenting vpon the 17 of <note place="margin">

Who euer yet read in the <hi>Ancients,</hi> but that by the <hi>heads, hills,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> in this place, ſuch ſenſes were to be gathered, which might better fit Antichriſt, then Chriſt Ieſus our Lord and Sauiour: And who (that is in his ſenſes) can otherwiſe interpret theſe <hi>heads, hills,</hi> and <hi>Kings;</hi> then of ſuch as ſhall bee ſeruiceable to the Beaſt? who beareth them, and of whom they are parts and members? With what for head then, can they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his gouernment by Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> to be ſignified by the ſixth <hi>King?</hi> And if I miſtake it not, there is a mere impoſſibilitie in it, for how doth the Angell ſay to <hi>S.

I am wearied in tracing of their follies; let vs then conſider, what the true meaning of the Prophecie is, as it ſhall pleaſe God to aſſiſt with his grace.</p>
               <p>By cleare conſequence then of the Prophecie, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is recounted in ancient and autenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtories, we are inforced by euidence of truth, to interpret the <hi>ſeuen Kings</hi> (ſignified by ſeauen <hi>Hills</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi> for ſeuen kindes and ſorts of Gouernments; whereof fiue, to wit, of <hi>Kings,</hi> of <hi>Conſulls,</hi> of <hi>Dictatours,</hi> of <hi>Decemvires,</hi> of <hi>Tribunes,</hi> were paſt; the ſixth, of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> was then; the ſeuenth, to wit, the vſurped Regall rule of the Goſhes, was to ſucceed, but <hi>to continue for a ſhort time.</hi> This being ſo, then by ineuitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is muſt needs follow, that the next <hi>Rome-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,</hi> which ſucceeded the Emperiall (which was and ruled whileſt <hi>S.

Now that the Pope did giue life to the image of the Beaſt after the ſixth and ſeuenth head; and after the Beaſt was wounded, either by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>

But if wee will not interpret the <hi>Pope</hi> by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Vicarian power, to haue made the Image of the firſt beaſt to ſpeake in himſelfe, and in his owne Papall Imperiall gouernment; then ſecondly wee may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus, that he maketh an Image of the firſt beaſt to ſpeake, in ſuch ſeeming Image-Emperours, as hee hath ſubſtituted vpon the wounding of the beaſt in one of his heades; I ſaid Image-Emperours; for they are no other then <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>ſhadowes</hi> of Imperiall dignitie; for ſo much as concerneth Roman Emperial dignitie or the command ouer <hi>Rome:</hi> I ſaid truely they are no other then <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>ſhadowes</hi> for ſo much as concerneth <hi>Romes</hi> ſoueraigntie. For what are theſe Emperours elſe then <hi>Homines Papae, The Popes liege men?</hi> are they not to be deſtituted at his pleaſure; and to bee inſtituted at his pleaſure? ſo that none of them can ſpeake <hi>Romanus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> vntill they ſhall haue renounced all right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Saint <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> as they ſpeak. But for my part I cannot thinke that the Popes making of the Image of the Beaſt to ſpeake, is to be vnderſtood thus; for there are ſome ſtrong reaſons againſt it, which yet are for the former. Firſt, the Prophet ſaith, that the <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.</note> Falſe-prophet ſhould cauſe all to be killed, who would not worſhip the Image of the beaſt; the which as it hath beene plentifully accompliſhed, vpon ſuch as haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his <hi>Supremacie</hi> and <hi>Papall</hi> gouernment: ſo wee doe not finde that he hath been ſo carefull to cauſe any to be killed for denying the dignitie of his <hi>nominall Emperours.</hi> It is apparant hee keepeth them vp only to cloke his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſme,</hi> which was not to appeare before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17944:136"/> of the <hi>Emperiall</hi> dignitie from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 15.</note> he laboureth ſtill tooth and naile to vphold ſome <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Emperours,</hi> leſt the ignominie of his <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> ſhould be more liuely diſcouered. <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly we finde, that all both great and ſmall, free and bound, are to profeſſe ſubiection to the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beaſt; the which as it was neuer fulfilled touching ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to his <hi>nominall Emperours</hi> either of the <hi>Franckes</hi> or <hi>Germaines;</hi> ſo it is moſt fully compleated in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Image-monarchie</hi> of the Pope where it is an Article of faith, that all <hi>Creatures</hi> are bound vnder paine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting <note place="margin">Bonif. vnam ſanctam, de ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioritate &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia.</note> ſaluation, to be ſubiect to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly we finde, that the tenne Kings, which had not receiued power in the Prophets time, but were to receiue the ſame preſently vpon the diſſolution of the beaſt; we finde I ſay, that theſe tenne Kings were to giue their power <hi>vnto the beaſt, whoſe wound was healed, and whoſe Image was made, vntill the wordes of God were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Now as this hath neuer beene accompliſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their <hi>nominall Emperours,</hi> who haue ſcarſly in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> (for without <hi>Germany</hi> they are <hi>ſans terre)</hi> a few free common-wealths at their command; ſo it hath been moſt perfectly compleated in the <hi>Romane Papall State,</hi> where iuſt at the very time, when the Pope made the Image of the beaſt to ſpeake in his <hi>Papall</hi> gouernment; thoſe tenne Kings, which came out of the ſame Empire with him vpon the diſſolution of the heads, gaue their power vnto him; ſubiecting their <hi>thrones</hi> and their <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> to his command. And this expoſition ſeemeth more cleare, if we doe withall conſider, that theſe Kings which were at the firſt her deuoutes, were afterwardes to fall into ſo great diſliking of her, that they would by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees make <hi>her deſolate, eate her fleſh,</hi> and in the end <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume her with fire;</hi> the which how in part it is alreadie performed, the conditions of <hi>England, Denmarke, Sweue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland &amp;c.</hi> doe declare and make manifeſt: For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17944:136"/> as the Countries with their Soueraignes, were at the firſt together with all other kingdomes of the weſt ſubiected to the <hi>Pope;</hi> ſo now they are become his fatall enemies. And here we are not (for further confirmation) to leaue vnconſidered, how the ſubiection to the Pope when he made the Image of the Beaſt to ſpeake, was ſo vniuerſall that all kinreds and Nations were ſubiect to his power, as it is deſcribed in the 13. of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> yea they were with him <hi>to fight againſt the lambe and to ouercome the lambe,</hi> that is to take away as it were from open view and knowledge the true and intire profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie; which accordingly happened, as it is manifeſt; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelues doe glory, that all <hi>Kings and kinreds,</hi> all Nations and Kingdomes, were then ſubiect at leſt, to the Pope, when hee firſt came to make more ſpeciall vſe of his vniuerſall Supremacie; which was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the decay of the beaſt, as is moſt manifeſt. And as his extent grew then on by degrees to be vniuerſall; ſo by degrees as by experience it is euident, it haſteneth to bee confined within Saint <hi>Peters</hi> pretenſed Patrimonie; Lord Ieſus ſay Amen.</p>
               <p>There is a third ſpeciall miracle, which ſome Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians would gladly for the clearing of the Pope aſcribe to Antichriſt; It is, that Antichriſt ſhould feigne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dead, and by the Arte of the Deuill ſhould raiſe himſelfe vp againe, which as yet ſay they none of the Popes haue done; <hi>ergo</hi> they are not Antichriſt. Alas good Sirs, into what plunges are you driuen? your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> with many other of yours, doth for very incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the miracle relect the ſame, and how filly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is, it thus appeareth: For firſt, the Prophet doth not ſay that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was wounded, but that one of his heades was <hi>(quaſi occiſum)</hi> as it were ſlaine, by which we muſt of neceſſitie vnderſtand, one of the Kings, and Kingly gouernments expounded in the 17. of the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> to haue beene ſo neere vtter ouerthrowing, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17944:137"/> it ſeemed dead; and yet was raiſed againe. Doth not your vulgar reading expreſly ſay, <hi>(plaga mortis eius cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata) the wound of death was cured;</hi> that is, a mortall wound was cured; but it ſaith not, he was reuiued after he was dead. Againe, how incongruous is your <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and your <hi>Rabbies</hi> in their declaration? who ſay, that Antichriſt ſhall feigne himſelfe dead, and yet ſhould be raiſed vp, by the power of the Deuill? What Sirs? if Antichriſt doe but counterfeit, and diſſemblingly ſhut his eyes, what neede ſhall hee then haue of the Deuills Arte, to raiſe him vp againe? Againe, what falſaries are thoſe, who ſay Antichriſt counterfeits his wound, when as the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſaith expreſly, that one of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> heades was as it were ſlaine? that the wound was <hi>(plaga mortis) a mortall wound, that the wound was cured? And all the world admired after the beaſt?</hi> but ſeeing our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, would needes hereout drawe an argument, to cleare their Pope; let vs endeauour out of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame, to ſhew him to be Antichriſt: For clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which:</p>
               <p>Wee muſt vnderſtand according to the expoſition of the Angell himſelfe to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 17. Chapter, by the head, which was wounded, one of the ſeuen Kings; and ſo by comparing the 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. and 8. verſes of the 13. Chapter, with the 8. and 11. verſes of the 17. Chapter, wee ſhall clearely finde, that the King or kingly ſtate wounded, muſt probably bee that, vnder which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his prophecie; which being ſo, I doe in good earneſt demand of the Pontificians, by what Rome-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ſucceeding after the Emperial was the wound cured? wounded as the 7. but recured as the eighth? for ſo ſaith the holy Ghoſt; <hi>And the beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>euen he is the eight, and is of the ſeauen, and goeth into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now I demand in good earneſt, what Rome-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, other then that of the Emperours, hath been wounded as it were to death, and yet recured againe?
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17944:137"/> what mortall wound can be better thought vpon (then either that of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Longobardes?</hi> or that of the <hi>Henries,</hi> and <hi>Frederikes)</hi> if we think of that of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Longobardes,</hi> cleare it is the wound was cured by the Popes, by their meanes and procurations, and for their owne good and their reuiuing againe.</p>
               <p>But what if a man would leaue the former, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this wounding, of thoſe woundes, which your <note place="margin">If we make the Pope the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth head then we are to take him ruling <hi>Rome</hi> with his intermixt hornes of the Lambe at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatines</hi> relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing the ſame.</note> Papall <hi>Rome-gouernment</hi> receiued from the <hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Frederikes,</hi> in your <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Gregories,</hi> and make them the 7. head? for then were your Popes brought ſo low vpon their knees, that they ſeemed dead, yet (ſee the Fate of <hi>Rome</hi> for reigning) on a ſuddaine they were ſo reuiued, raiſed vp, and their deadly woundes healed, that one of them, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. made <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. dance his leaſure three daies and nights bareheaded and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed at <hi>Canuſium:</hi> the other <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. ſet his foote vpon the necke of <hi>Frederike Barbaroſſa,</hi> in the ſight of all <hi>Venice</hi> at Saint <hi>Markes</hi> Church doore; and thereupon it was that the whole world admired after the Beaſt, <hi>that was and is not; that was the eight and is of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi>

For my part I referre this to bee cenſured by the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I haue called Antichriſt both of the ſeuen and the eight: of the ſeuen becauſe in his Papal-ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, whileſt the <hi>Gothes</hi> ruled, hee next ſucceeded the Emperiall, in which hee was wounded afterwardes; but his wound being cured, he ſo trampled downe the <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Frederikes,</hi> and all ſucceeding Emperours, that hee ioyned the Scepter and the keyes together. And whereas before hee pretended by vertue of the <hi>lambes hornes,</hi> that is Chriſts <hi>Vicarian power,</hi> to bee abſolute and ſupreame in ſpiritualls, hee was ſo reuiued and animated by the curing of his deadly woundes; that ſince he hath challenged an abſolute Monarchie both in <hi>ſpiritualls and</hi>

            <div n="11" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Wherein is examined the generall properties of Antichriſts miracles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, out of the greatneſſe &amp; quantirie of them, they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> muſt be great for quantity, and many for number; for ſo our Sauiour hath foretould in Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi>

Now which of the Pontifician, can or will denie their miracles to be many? which of them doth not exult and inſult againſt vs for the greatneſſe of them? doth not Maſter <hi>Floode</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:17944:138"/> heere, both for number and excellencie compare them, with thoſe of the primitiue Church? this point is cleare; I goe on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I argue out of another condition of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> miracles, that they ſhall be <hi>(mendaeia &amp; falſa)</hi> lying and falſe. The miracles of Antichriſt are called in Scripture <hi>mendacia, lying,</hi> not becauſe all of them ſhall be fictious or forged; nor becauſe all of them ſhall indeed tend to the perſwaſion of lyes; but alſo in this reſpect they are called <hi>mendacia,</hi> mendacious, lying, becauſe many of them ſhall be counterfet; for Antichriſt and <note place="margin">See <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Pont. cap.</hi> 15. 2 Theſſal. 2. 10.</note> his, amongſt many great miracles they ſhall doe, ſhall alſo pretend many falſe and counterfet ones, <hi>(in fallacia erroris) in the deception of errour,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And I ſuppoſe, there is no Pontifician will denie this; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no ingenuous Pontifician can denie, but that there is ſtore of mendacious and counterfet miracles related by the <hi>Legendaries</hi> of their Church. Many are the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">See <hi>Canus Lec: lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Lira in Dan.</hi>
                  </note> which are recounted in the booke of Franciſcan <hi>Conformities:</hi> but how many of theſe are derided, and ſcorned by many learned of that Church? Great are the miracles and many, which our late <hi>Ignatians</hi> doe father vpon their Founder <hi>Ignatius Loiola;</hi> but ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme <note place="margin">The great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Suſſex reading the tale of <hi>S.

The matter is plaine, I need not ſtand vpon it, for there would be no end if any ſhould ſtand to relate an infinitie of lying narrations, which many of themſelues deride.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I argue out of the effect of Antichriſtian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>Third</label> to wit, that <hi>many ſhall be ſeduced by them, yea the</hi>

                  <hi>very elect if it were poſſible,</hi> and that for them the whole <note place="margin">Mar. 13. 2 Theſſ. 2. 10. Apoc. 13.</note>

               <p>Fourthly, I argue out of the manner, by which the Antichriſtian falſe Prophets doe their miracles, to wit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> they ſhall doe them in the very name of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Many</hi> ſaith Chriſt (ſpeaking of them) <hi>ſhall come in my</hi>

                  <hi>name,</hi> to wit, as pretending his faith, his power: for by no meanes it can be vnderſtood, in that ſort as the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians commonly expound it; that is, that many ſhall come in the name of Chriſt pretending themſelues to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and denying Chriſt himſelfe. For if ſuch a thing were prophecied by Chriſt, how could his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome haue added, that the very elect ſhould be in great danger to be ſeduced by them? What? are the elect ſuch inconſtant <hi>reedes,</hi> to be ſhaken with that which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie common Chriſtian at the firſt ſound would abhorre, hate and deteſt? No, no ſir, Antichriſt and his ſhall come in the name of Chriſt, pretending his doctrine; they ſhall make an apoſtacie from Chriſt, yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame by denying Chriſt, their working ſhall be as the Apoſtle termeth it <hi>(myſterium iniquitatis) a myſterie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 7. 10. See Apoc: 7. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of iniquitie (in fallacia erroris) in the deception of errour.</hi> Now manifeſt it is, that the miracles done in the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Church, are pretended to be done in the name of Chriſt, and therefore it is, that ſo many are ſeduced by them; therefore it is, that when ſome Chriſtians of the reformed Churches doe heare of the ſame, they do as it were in ſome ſort begin to ſtagger, to heare that Rome doth flouriſh with the glory of miracles, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be done onely in the name of Chriſt. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a dangerous blocke, at which the very Elect
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17944:139"/> might be in danger to ſtumble; were they not vpheld by him who hath promiſed that <hi>no man ſhall take his ſheep</hi>

                  <hi>out of his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, I argue out of an vniuerſalitie of Antichriſtian <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>Fifth</label> miracles, which ſhall be done by Antichriſt and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in all places, for <hi>the whole world muſt admire after</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc: 13. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>them;</hi> they muſt be done <hi>(in conſpectu hominum) in the fight of men</hi> and view of the world. Now the ſame is punctually performed, or pretended to be performed by the Pontificians; who haue in all ſuch Countries as obey their Pope, ſome <hi>Miracle-Sanctuaries;</hi> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, at <hi>Burgis, Compoſtella, Montſerrato</hi> in Spaine; at <hi>Lile, Sichem, Arras, Mechline, Hall</hi> in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; at <hi>Rhemes, Shallon</hi> in France: And in England, time was, we had the <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich, Walſingham, &amp;c.</hi> It bootes not to adde of other Countries, the point is cleare.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I argue out of the ſpecialtie of the Miniſters <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>Sixth</label> of theſe miracles; It is apparant in holy Scriptures, that they are not to be the ordinarie followers of Antichriſt, <note place="margin">Matth: 24. 24. Mar. 13. 22. Luc: 17. 2 Theſſ: 2. Apoc: 9. 13.</note> but they are to be his ſpeciall <hi>Deuoutes,</hi> and as it were ſworne ſlaues. Now in Poperie it is moſt cleare, that their <hi>Miraculists,</hi> are <hi>Monkes, Fryers, Abbots</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſuch as are by a more ſpeciall bonde and linke more then ordinarie people or Prieſts, tyed faſt in ſlauerie and ſubiection to the Sea of Rome. This point is cleare, ſo cleare, that I vndertake there is not any of their Church (if zealous) who will dare to attribute the ordinarie working of miracles to any that are not, at leaſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion deuoted to their Holy Father. For this cauſe they cannot endure to heare that <hi>Ignatius</hi> the bleſſed Martyr and Patriarke of Conſtantinople, did any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, becauſe he did oppoſe againſt the Popes, arrogating iuriſdiction ouer the Churches of Bulgarie.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, I argue out of the circumſtance of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>7</label> time when Antichriſtian miracles are to be moſt rife.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17944:140"/> The time is pointed out vnto vs in holy Scriptures, at <note place="margin">2 Theſſ: 2. Apoc. 13 &amp; 17.</note> the diſſolution of the Roman Empire, and at the ſetting vp, and in the time of another Monarchicall Rome Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in ſteed thereof; which, that it is now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <note place="margin">See aboue in my firſt ground of reaſons.</note> who ſeeth not? The Romane Emperour being a meere <hi>Nominall,</hi> a very ſhadow of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> dignitie reſting in the Biſhop of Rome, who is his abſolute <hi>Lord,</hi> the Emperour his <hi>Subſtitute;</hi> the Pope the <hi>Liege,</hi> the Emperour the <hi>Liegeman;</hi> and hath in the opinion of the Pope, his Purpuratts, and other, no more Soueraigntie in Rome, then the King of Spaine hath.</p>
               <p>And hereout ariſeth another conſideration of time, to wit, that at the very time when Antichriſt his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall doe many and great miracles, then the true Chriſtians ſhall worke either none at all, or elſe ſo few, that in compariſon of the great multitudes, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt <note place="margin">Seé aboue <hi>ſaepe.</hi> and <hi>Greg. lib.</hi> 33 <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. <hi>mor. in Job.</hi>
                  </note> chriſt and his ſhall do, they will ſeeme none at all. Now cleare it is, that the Popiſh Church aboundeth with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and doth with inſultation twit and reproue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches for want of the ſame; and this is a very expreſſe <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition, which is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the true Chriſtians and the falſe in the time of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, <note place="margin">

                  </note> the falſe ſhall exult in their miracles, which to the true ſeruants of Chriſt ſhall be matter of tryall and probation. and hereout,</p>
               <p>Eightly, I argue thus. In the time of Antichriſt ſuch <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>Eight</label> people as ſhall be of his damnable profeſſion, ſhall be eager and greedie after miracles, in which his chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <note place="margin">Apec: 13. 2 Theſſ: 2.</note> and falſe Prophets ſhall egregiouſly exult. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the true Chriſtians ſhall recurre only vnto the Scriptures, reſt onely vpon Chriſts promiſes and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their faith, according as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hic est fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des &amp; patientia Sanctorum: Here Saints muſt vſe their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>faith and patience.</hi> This is now clearely accompliſhed in the Popiſh Synagogue, the diſciples whereof are greedy and moſt eager after miracles; which appeareth by their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17944:140"/> moſt tedious Pilgrimages. Contrariwiſe, thoſe of the reformed Churches, are very well contented to want the ſame, relying onely vpon the aſſurance of their faith in Chriſt and his promiſes, deliuered in ſacred Scriptures, and confirmed by ſuch miracles as are there recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. and ſo hereout,</p>
               <p>Ninthly, I argue, that in Antichriſts time, thoſe that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">reaſon. </seg>Ninth</label> are his, as they are eager after miracles, ſo they ſhall alſo be very prone to beleeue them, the which is ſo apparant in all the whole popiſh Congregations, that I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that if they were not bewitched <hi>(faſcinations erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris)</hi>

When I conſidered theſe things, then I could not diuine from what Spirit ſuch illuſions might ariſe, to obſerue the beſt and moſt zealous of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be commonly moſt inueigled in that kinde; but now I obſerue it was no other then what <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>I could here adde very many particulars, eſpecially of Engliſh Papiſts who are moſt prone and inclinable to beleeue any tale that is told them of any of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, witneſſe the fabulous narration of the ſhining face of Frier <hi>Buckley,</hi> vpon <hi>London</hi> Bridge; as alſo of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17944:141"/> ſtopping and ſtaying of the horſe that drew the hurdle, witneſſe the prodigious ſtanding of a pixe with an hoſt-Chriſt in it, vpon a table in a Chamber, A pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuant ſearching the chamber round about, and yet could not ſee the God.

               <p>Thus I haue cleerly (though briefly) faſtened all the generall qualities and conditions of Antichriſtian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles recounted in holie Scriptures vpon the Popiſh, ſo intirelie and faſt, that I dare vndertake neither you maſter <hi>Flud</hi> nor any other ſhall be able to remoue them. I vndertake further that all other circumſtances of the ſame recounted in Scripture will eaſily and with great facilitie be iuſtly applied to your Popiſh miracles. And ſo I come to examine ſome ſpeciall paſſages of ſacred Scripture, by which as by a line of truth, we are led to the finding out of Antichriſtian miracles; and excepting two I will eſpecially examine ſome that are not much looked into by others; all I cannot ſtand to examine, yet this I confidently adde, there is not any one paſſage of Scripture in which there is mention made of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt or of his miniſters, which may not be applied and fitly be laid vpon the Pope and his, and ſo conſequently all the <hi>adiuncts</hi> and properties of them, will in like ſort adhere to him and his.</p>

               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:17944:142"/>
               <p> For the declaration of this point that the Papiſts are here pointed at by Chriſt, for their teaching of him (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>tranſubſtantiating diuinity)</hi> to be in <hi>ſecrets, penetralls, cheſts Tabernacles, &amp;c.</hi> I am to make a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition out of S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> which is receiued by them all; to wit, that the ſacred Scriptures are euer literally to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; according to the plaine and ordinary ſenſe of the words, whenſoeuer the ſame doth not containe any abſurdity, nor imply any impoſſibility, as the literall vnderſtanding of this place doth not; but cleerly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs, a Popiſh practice daily acted in their Churches.</p>
               <p>The ancient expoſitors of S. <hi>Mathews</hi> Goſpell, either the <hi>primo primi,</hi> or <hi>ſecundo primi,</hi> as I may ſo call them, who liued in the purer times of the Church; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their daies this prophecy of Chriſt was not compleate (for before <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> was hatched, the ſecret and myſticall preſence of Chriſt in <hi>ſecrets,</hi> and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate chambers, was not preached nor beleeued) doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this text myſtically, of the priuate conuenticles and aſſemblies of heretickes, and ſchiſmatickes, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſts Church to be with them; which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand, for this one or two inſtances if there were no other in this paſſage: firſt, our Sauiour ſhould not then haue deliuered any ſpeciall property and condition of the great Antichriſtian <hi>Synagogue,</hi> which was to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, not to be confined within any one kingdome, which yet that he doth; all, yea all, and of all ſides doe ingenuouſly confeſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the prophecy were ſo to be interpreted, of the myſticall and ſpirituall preſence of Chriſt in priuate places, then it would moſt of all concerne the true Church of Chriſt; which in the time of Antichriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 6. and 13. 7.</note> to the ſenſe of all and of all ſides, is to flie into the <hi>deſert,</hi> to liue obſcurely and hiddenly as welnigh ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; yea it would moſt neerly haue touched the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:17944:142"/> Church her ſelfe, in the daies of her purity, when ſhe made the mount <hi>Soract without,</hi> and the Cripts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. vita Silueſtri.</note> the City, to be her chiefeſt <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fury of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who thinke that our Sauiour did in this his prediction point at <hi>Theudas</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, or <hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Galilean</hi> or ſuch like; <note place="margin">Acts 5. 36. 37.</note> but their miſtaking is not worthy of confutation, for beſides that <hi>Theudas</hi> was at leaſt twenty yeeres before Chriſts preaching; ſo all circumſtances of the text doe euince, that the prophecy cannot be interpreted of any ſo baſe and contemptible <hi>leaders:</hi> no no, Chriſt pointeth vnto vs Antichriſt the great and his falſe Prophets.</p>
               <p>Here by the Readers patience, I will ſhew how <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> the grand Ignatian ſhuffleth this text ouer with a very ſhort cut; as though he were ſurpriſed (examining the ſame) with ſome fit of a <hi>feare-feauer,</hi> his words vpon it are theſe, and onely theſe, <hi>Poſuit duo pro omnibus &amp;c. Chriſt put (ſaith he) or mentioned only two contrary places for all, the deſert, and the Penetralls; that is, the inwardeſt and moſt retired part of the houſe, that he might ſignifie in what manner ſoeuer, in what habit ſoeuer, in what place ſoeuer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt ſhould come, he ſhould not be beleeued; further to examine and ſearch of the deſert, and Penetralls it is not the part of a ſober Interpreter.</hi> Thus <hi>Maldonat:</hi> moſt of which his words, eſpecially thoſe, <hi>in what habit ſoeuer, in what place ſoeuer,</hi> in <hi>what manner ſoeuer,</hi> if they were throughly examined; they would make little for the Popiſh Goſpel of Chriſt, vnder the habit of bread in a myſticall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but reall in their <hi>Boxes, Pixes, Euchariſt-arkes:</hi> but omitting them all, I eſpecially obſerue thoſe words of his, <hi>It is not the part of a ſober Interpreter to examine more of the deſert and Penetralls,</hi> then his <hi>Father-hood</hi> beſtowed vpon vs. What he feared, I will by Gods aſſiſtance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; which done the reader may eaſily obſerue, that this deuiſe of <hi>Maldonat</hi> was <hi>(ex conſcientia imbecillitatis)</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My firſt reaſon that theſe wordes of Chriſt are literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderſtood, againſt ſome who would pretend to teach a ſecret corporall preſence of Chriſt himſelfe (not another Chriſt) vpon earth; I frame out of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon of Chriſt himſelfe, which hee maketh againſt them. Firſt, <hi>beleeue them not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>if any ſhall ſay behould he is in the penetralls, in the ſecrets</hi> (or as the Remiſts interpret it, <hi>in cloſets.) For at the lightening com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth into the weſt, ſo alſo ſhall the comming of the ſonne of man be;</hi> thus argueth Chriſt: now as cleare as the very heauens it is, that this of Chriſt is to be vnderſtood of Chriſts corporall, and reall comming in perſon to iudgement: which granted, then our infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe Sauiour, (who without blaſphemie may not bee impeached of an impertinent diſcourſe) muſt needes be thought to oppoſe this his publike comming in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17944:144"/> againſt ſome ſecret, reall preſence of him, before that time, pretended by the falſe Prophets. For if hee ſhould haue ſpoken this only againſt the priuate <hi>Conuenticles</hi> of <hi>Heretikes</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatikes,</hi> pretending his Church, and ſpirituall or myſticall preſence to be amongſt them; then ſhall he be thought thus to argue: If any falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall teach you any falſe doctrine, or ſeeke to draw you to any priuate <hi>Conuenticle,</hi> beleeue them not, for my comming at the latter day to iudgement ſhall not be ſecret, but publike, in glory; like <hi>as the lightning which ſhineth from the East, and appeareth vnto the West:</hi> and ſhall ſuch maner of arguing beſeem the infinite wiſdom of the Father? who dare ſay ſo? but vnderſtanding the ſame as the truth, and the Text requireth, then is the reaſon moſt diuine, befitting the infinite wiſdome of God, thus. If any ſhall teach you, that I am in any ſecret place, or deſert, here or there, for you to make pilgrimage vnto me, or to worſhip and adore mee in your priuate cloſets, or in the retiredſt, and moſt priuate part of the houſe, (my houſe is the Church or Temple) beleeue them not; for I ſhall not be corporally and preſentially (thus I interpret according to Chriſts ordinarie power and prouidence) preſent vpon earth, vntill <hi>like as the lightning appeareth from the East vnto the West,</hi> ſo alſo I ſhall appeare in Glorie and Maieſtie, filling with glory the heauens euen from <hi>Eaſt to West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this expoſition as conſequent, is confirmed by the compariſon or ſecond reaſon, which our Sauiour maketh againſt the falſe Prophets, thus: <hi>Whereſoeuer the dead bodie is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth: 24. 28.</note> Touching which ſaying of our Sauiour, all interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being ſeriouſly weighed; that of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in hunc locum.</note> many of the Ancient and moderne writers, will be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto the truth, to wit, that like as the dead bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly expoſed in the fields, the Eagles by naturall inſtinct doe repaire to the ſame to prey thereon; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17944:144"/> where hee himſelfe ſhould be in preſence, there ſhould not be wanting multitudes of Angells, aſſiſting and miniſtring vnto him, and by ſpirituall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion feeding on him: So that our Sauiour argueth thus, If any falſe Prophets ſhall teach, that I ſhall be obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome hidden manner vpon earth, in <hi>Coffer, Celler, or Deſert,</hi> beleeue them not; for like as the carcaſe is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without <hi>Eagles,</hi> ſo for hereafter my preſence after my aſcenſion, ſhall neuer be without multitudes of <hi>Angells,</hi> aſſiſting and miniſtring vnto mee. And ſurely if wee <note place="margin">Act: 7. &amp; 9. 2 Cor: 12. Apoc: 1. &amp; 2. &amp; ſaepe.</note> ſearch the Scriptures wee ſhall finde, that thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie apparitions, which our Sauiour made after his aſcenſion, to ſome vpon earth, were neuer but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as in <hi>glory;</hi> neuer without the preſence and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Angells. And ſo I come to another reaſon of this my expoſition.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Reaſon I make thus: Our Sauiour in this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> place, for the fore-inſtruction of his faithfull, giueth vnto them certaine cleare and euident ſignes, which ſhould <note place="margin">Behold I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Matth: 24. 25.</note> happen before his comming to iudgement, and by which they ſhould be armed againſt the <hi>wyles</hi> and <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of Antichriſt. Now ſignes that they may be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their nature and kinde, ſignificant, they muſt be facill and eaſie to be vnderſtood, and muſt be taken as they ſound, vnleſſe it be otherwiſe expreſſed. And for this cauſe, as all other ſignes in this chapter, deliuered by our Sauiour, are literally to be vnderſtood (as the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians themſelues do interpret them) ſo neither is there any reaſon, why this paſſage ſhould not be alſo literally vnderſtood, it being of ſo great conſequence, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the perdition and ſaluation of many ſoules.</p>
               <p>And to adde a confirmation to this reaſon; if theſe words of Chriſt were onely to be vnderſtood <hi>mystically,</hi> againſt the aſſemblies of <hi>Heretikes</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatikes,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging Chriſts Church, and ſpirituall preſence to be only with them; I cannot ſee for my part, what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17944:145"/> for the faithfulls inſtruction, might be gathered out of this ſigne, which yet is the importanſt of all the reſt. For, is it not moſt euident by a neuer intermitted expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſince Chriſts time, that euery ſeuerall <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Heretikes</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatikes,</hi> as it challengeth to it ſelfe, the power and myſticall preſence of Chriſt, ſo it obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to all other, the lacke of the ſame? yea and the moſt <hi>Orthodoxe Church</hi> of Chriſt it ſelfe, hath her <hi>ebbs</hi> and <hi>flowes;</hi> and then was ſhee pureſt, when in <hi>criptts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, ſecret woods,</hi> and <hi>holes</hi> ſhee made her aſſemblies. Therefore to preach Chriſt preſent <hi>in ſecrets,</hi> in this ſenſe, cannot be a note, propertie, or ſigne of the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Synagogue, as by all it is ſuppoſed and granted to be, and is by the faithfull to be taken according to Chriſts forewarning.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon I deduce, out of the energie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of certaine words here vſed by our Sauiour. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> the word, <hi>Behold,</hi> thrice repeated, which as it is an Aduerbe of Admiration, ſo it is alwaies demonſtratiue of ſome ſingular matter worthy admiration, worthy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, as is cleare throughout the Scriptures: So that, as <hi>S. Iohn Baptist</hi> pointing the ſonne of God to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, ſee the Lambe of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh: 1. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo theſe falſe Prophets, doe pretend to inuite their diſciples and followers to behold and ſee Chriſt in the deſerts, ſecrets, cloſets, &amp;c. which is egregiouſly acted by the Papiſts. I obſerue alſo, the Aduerbs <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> which euer doe deſigne ſome ſpeciall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of place, as through the Scriptures it is apparant; and if to them we adioyne the ſpecialties of the places, <hi>in the ſecrets, in the deſert,</hi> the force of the Prepoſition <hi>in,</hi> and the verbe ſubſtantiue <hi>is, (He is in the deſert, He is in the penetralls)</hi> my intent will more eaſily appeare, that the falſe Prophets do pretend ſome ſecret corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, requiring faith and beleefe, and ſigh alſo, with beholding of him; which is clearely con
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17944:145"/> firmed by our Sauiours doubled precept and charge, <hi>beleeue them not</hi> and <hi>goe not out;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, the falſe prophets will inuite you both to <hi>goe out and to behold,</hi> and to beleeue, that is, to ſee me in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manner as they ſhall preach, and yet alſo to beleeue the hidden myſtery of my preſence which they teach: but looke to it, <hi>behold I haue foretold you,</hi> neither <hi>goe out</hi> to ſee me in any myſticall or hidden forme or ſhape, nor <hi>yet beleeue</hi> their myſterious diuinity teaching my carnall preſence tending and leading to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>My fourth reaſon, that this prophecy is thus litterally <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">reaſon. </seg>Fourth</label> to be vnderſtood is this; becauſe ſo vnderſtood, it is moſt euidently fulfilled, and compleated in the Roman Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; who make it a prime myſtery, yea the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of their religion, to preach and teach Chriſt to be ſo in <hi>penetralls, ſecrets, boxes, cloſets, &amp;c.</hi> A prophecy vntill it be fulfilled, is as a riddle, or a booke ſealed; but once fulfilled it is no longer a hidden, but a manifeſt truth. Now that it is compleated in the Romane Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, it is ouer manifeſt: For this cauſe they cry out dayly; Behold he is in the <hi>Tabernacles</hi> of our Churches; Behold he is in the <hi>Penetrals</hi> and ſecrets of our <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;</hi> Behold hee is in our <hi>Euchariſt-arks;</hi> and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Hoſtes</hi> at <hi>Meclines,</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold</hi> he is in our <hi>lockt Coffers,</hi> and <hi>arkes;</hi> borne vpon the backes of white ambling <hi>Palfreyes,</hi> preceding our Holy Father whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee maketh his remoucalls: Behold hee is in our ſecret <hi>Chappels, locked Coffers,</hi> priuate <hi>cloſets;</hi> you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold (cry they) the outward accidents, but beleeue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward myſtery; the true and corporal preſence of Chriſt; you muſt ſee and <hi>beleeue, behold</hi> and <hi>admire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the further clearing of this matter, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <note place="margin">Al circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy fulfilled in the Papiſts.</note> that this point is fulfilled in the Romane congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I adde ſome few obſeruations concerning diuers other, yea moſt circumſtances of this prophecy. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Fourthly I note, and gather out of our Sauiours <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">obſer∣uation. </seg>Fourth</label> ſpeech, that theſe falſe prophets were to teach Chriſts preſence to <hi>be here and there,</hi> vp and downe, that is, in many hidden and ſecret places at once, and at the ſelfe ſame time: which as it was neuer performed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo it is punctually acted by the Papiſts; who at the ſelfe ſame time do preach Chriſt to be in ſo many places <hi>here and there</hi> euen in one Church, that it is not poſſible for any of their worſhippers, if hee will adore any one, but that hee muſt at the ſame time turne his backe vpon three or foure other Chriſts eleuated here and there, in the corners and Chappels of their Church; or reſerued in the tabernacles of their Church.</p>
               <p>Further, it is not vnworthy of obſeruing, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſpecialiſing and nominating the places in which theſe falſe prophets ſhould teach his preſence to be; hee

By all which, and more that might be ſaid, it is as cleare as noone dayes, that whether we interpret the words (<gap reason="foreign">

And ſo I conclude theſe my proofes; yet before I paſſe from this argument, I am to anſwere ſome few obiections, which may be made againſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; I will anſwere onely the chiefeſt, the reſt will fall of themſelues.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is obiected, that our Sauiour in this prophecy, <note place="margin">Firſt obiection</note> doeth foretell of ſome falſe prophets, which ſhould come and deny him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſhould teach another Chriſt:</p>
               <p>This obiection falleth eaſily, by all that which I haue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> ſaid; and is refuted by the ioynt conſent of all thoſe, who do apply this prophecy to all <hi>Schiſmatickes</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,</hi> becauſe they pretend Chriſts Church, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualll preſence to be onely with them.

               <p>Secondly it is obiected thus; Chriſt fore propheſieth <note place="margin">Second obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> of ſome falſe Preachers, who ſhould teach him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent amongſt men, as conuerſing with them, in humane ſhape, though in ſecret, in cloſſets, or abroad in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but this maketh nothing at all againſt the Papiſts, who teach Chriſt onely vnder the forme of bread and wine (not in humane ſhape) to be preſent in their <hi>boxes, cloſſets, penetrals:</hi> To this I anſwer diuerſe wayes, and each of them ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our Sauiour (to inſiſt vpon his expreſſe words) <note place="margin">Firſt Anſwer.</note> ſpeaketh nothing at all, touching his pretended conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in humane ſhape amongſt men; neither doth hee vtter any words, by which the ſame may bee gathered; he onely foretelleth his faithfull, that they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited by certaine <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> to behold him as preſent in <hi>penetrals, ſecrets</hi> or <hi>cloſets,</hi> and this as we euidently ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſome admirable ſort; requiring faith. <hi>(Beleeue them not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt) now I hope the Papiſts will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that all this is fulfilled with their Chriſt in their <hi>Secrets, Cloſets</hi> and <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> whereof <hi>Parſons</hi> was ſo <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, I anſwer; touching conuerſation; that <note place="margin">Second An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> the Pontificians cannot denie, but for their parts there is conuerſation betwixt themſelues, and this their <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for they are preſentially with him, they ſee him, they handle him, they ſpeake to him, they adorne him, they locke him vp, and carrie him about, they walke to him, they watch with him and for him, they cloath him and beare him; and they do all ſeruices to him, as to a Chriſt preſent.</p>
               <p>As for their Chriſts part, I hope they will not denie, but that he knoweth himſelfe to be with them; that hee heareth them and their praiers, hee ſeeth them and their geſtures; he weareth their ornaments and clothings, he doth ſecretly worke with his graces in their ſoules, and doth oftentimes many miraculous and prodigious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and cures amongſt them: is not this a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation? yes doubtleſſe, becauſe it is of an Intelligent pretended Chriſt, with his intelligent and vnderſtanding <hi>Deuoutes.</hi> If it bee obiected, that their Chriſt doth not ſpeake vnto them with vocall words, or ſound of mouth; alac, that is but one point of conuerſation, and the ſame may be ſupplied by ſignes, and ſome motions and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which the Prieſts make vpon him or about him, as well as a certaine Gentlewoman at Chicheſter, was <note place="margin">Miſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, that although ſome readings haue, <note place="margin">Third anſwer.</note> that theſe falſe prophets ſhould teach Chriſt to be in <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrals,</hi> as the vulgar; and <hi>Cloſets,</hi> as the <hi>Remiſts;</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate <note place="margin">The Remiſts interpret clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.

               </p>
               <p>That all theſe things here ſpoken, by theſe falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are vttered and acted now by the Popiſh <hi>Monks, Friars,</hi> &amp;c. No man can be ignorant, who daily heareth them chaunting out their doing of wonders, and caſting out of diuels in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the power of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things reſt to be proued; firſt, whether they bee <hi>operarij iniquitatis, the workers of iniquitie here ſpoken of.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whether it be probable that our Sauiour in this place, doe aime at Antichriſtian falſe prophets, or rather at ſome true Prophets and teachers, who teach his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine truly, confirming the ſame by miracles, and yet liue very wickedly.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, that the Popiſh <hi>mirabiliſts,</hi> are workers of <hi>Iniquitie,</hi> I referre the Reader to what I haue ſaide already: but that they are the ſpeciall workers of <hi>iniquitie,</hi> heere mentioned by our Sauiour, it may thus appeare: firſt, becauſe our Sauiour in this place ſeemeth moſt to reproue the iniquity of ſacrilegious iniuſtice: now what greater <hi>iniquitie</hi> of <hi>iniuſtice</hi> amongſt the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Prophets, then the iniquitie of ſymony: which maketh ſuch a generall inundation in all Popiſh Churches, that there is hardly a man to be found, who receiueth any benefice, dignity, &amp;c. at leſt from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17944:156"/> the bittereſt weed of <hi>iniquity</hi> which can grow in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our Sauiour alſo in this place, ſeemeth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to reproue the iniquitie of fraud and deception, as if hee ſhould ſay vnto the falſe prophets; you glory in your miracles and wonders as done in my name, and for my glory: but it is farre otherwiſe, for by them you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe a higheſt point of iniquity; to wit, by fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to draw my faithfull to the baſe worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of <hi>Creatures,</hi> and thereby ſeeking your owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to inthrall them in the bondage of your owne tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>Thirdly, if our Sauiour doe by theſe words, <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> comprehend workers of all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; then let vs aske the great <hi>Fauourers,</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> what manner of wickedneſſe it is which doth not reigne amongſt them.

               <p>It reſteth to be ſhewed and proued, whether the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> doe deliuer the ſame doctrines of <hi>Deuills,</hi> which the Apoſtle here condemneth; which that they doe, for the firſt point I thus make manifeſt. To inſiſt vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles expreſſe wordes, he ſaith onely, that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes ſhould forbid marriage &amp;c. which that the Popes and Papiſts doe, it is a caſe as manifeſt as noone daies: And their euaſion of this imputation is not worth a ruſh. For they anſwer that the Apoſtle intendeth onely ſuch <hi>Heretikes</hi> as doe forbid marriage, becauſe of naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe in the ſame. Their inſtance is moſt vaine; nay rather the Apoſtle purpoſely abſtaineth from mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any ſuch circumſtance of the <hi>hereſie,</hi> that ſo in his prophecie, hee might as well inuolue thoſe <hi>Heretikes</hi> which would teach marriage to be vncleane to the Vſers and Practiſers of it, againſt pretenſed commandes; as alſo thoſe who would condemn it as vncleane in it ſelfe. If the Apoſtle had intended the <hi>Manicheyes</hi> only, or ſuch like, he might eaſily haue expreſſed the circumſtance of their hereſie; but he did not ſo; ayming doubtleſſe at all thoſe, who ſhould forbid and inhibit marriage in thoſe, and to them, to whom God had commended or allowed it; and therefore he vſeth rather the words for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, as if he ſhould ſay theſe <hi>Heretikes</hi> will diſaprooue of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17944:160"/> 
                  <hi>marriage</hi> in reſpect of their own <hi>commandes</hi> in thoſe, and to thoſe, to whom they ſhall forbid the ſame.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe ſeriouſly bethinke themſelues they ſhall finde, that the ancient <hi>Manicheyes</hi> doe iumpe with them in this their hereſie about marriage in their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. epiſt.</hi> 74</note> Clergie; for as the Papiſts doe allow marriage in their <hi>Laickes,</hi> but vtterly forbid it in their <hi>Clerkes;</hi> ſo did the <hi>Manicheyes</hi> allowe marriage in their ordinarie <hi>Profeſſours,</hi> whom they did call <hi>(Auditores) Hearers,</hi> but vtterly forbidde and reprooue the ſame in their ſpeciall ones, whom they called <hi>Electi,</hi> their <hi>choſen and Elects.</hi> So that here we haue the <hi>Papiſts</hi> expreſly iumping with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheyes</hi> in this point.</p>
               <p>I note ſpecially, that the Apoſtle ſaith they ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid marriage, by which, he euidently inſinuateth, that the holy Spirits intention is, to note and ayme at ſuch <hi>Gouernours</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church, who ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Geneſ. 1. 22.</note> the Apoſtles and Gods ordinance, lay their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vpon <hi>celibacy</hi> and ſingle life forbidding marriage. Now this is the very ſelfe thing, which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue done. For vpon that (concerning which the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> Apoſtle <hi>had no precept but onely counſell)</hi> they haue laide their imperious commandes in their clergie, forbidding them to marry, yea and againſt their owne principles, haue laid a precept vpon a Counſell; commanding and requiring moſt ſtrictly all thoſe, who take orders to vow <hi>chaſtitie;</hi> which according to their owne principles God left in counſell and free election, and which the Apoſtle had onely power to counſell and perſwade.</p>
               <p>Their pretenſed ground of this their doing, to wit, becauſe celibacy and ſingle life is in perfection ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>matrimoniall ſtate,</hi> is vaine: for wee are not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>celibacie</hi> and ſingle life &amp; matrimoniall ſtate as they are in ſpeculation; but as they are in action, practiſe, and vſe; and ſo conſidered, cleare it is, that <hi>celibacy</hi> or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life is not to be preferred before <hi>matrimoniall</hi> ſtate in

               <p>Sometimes when I haue thought with my ſelfe of the ſtrange paradoxes, which are in theſe reuelations of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,</hi> I haue wondred how men of iudgement ſhould giue credit to the ſame, if the ſtrong illuſions of Sathan did not powerfully worke in them: fooliſh is that, where Chriſt telleth <hi>Briget,</hi> that hee is <hi>Trinus &amp; vnus, Three and one.</hi> And little for the Popes credit is that, where Chriſt himſelfe deſcribeth the Pope to bee <hi>worſe then Lucifer, more vniuſt then Pilate, more immane then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das more abominable then the Iewes themſelues:</hi> how vaine is that, in the title of the firſt chapter of the booke, of the heauenly Emperour, which hath thus, <hi>that God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the world to be ruled with a double power, to wit, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſticall</hi>

I had two excellent ſeruants, one of them was a Clerk, the other a Laicke, the firſt was Peter my Apoſtle, hauing the office of a Clerke, the ſecond was my Apoſtle Paul, as a Laick:</hi> what an excellent inference may heereout be inferred for the Popes power to gouerne the whole Church as a Clerke? and the whole world as a Laike?

If the Pope ſhould lead innumerable ſoules to hell, yet no man may iudge his fact, nor condemne his proceedings:</hi> which yet was not obſerued by the Prelates of the French church, in the time of King <hi>Hugh,</hi> when as at a Synode gathered <note place="margin">Sinod.

                  <p>Daies and yeeres would faile me, if I ſhould ſtand to recount all viſions, which might be produced againſt themſelues out of their owne Authors. I haue heard ſome learned wiſh, that a maſſe of their viſions might be publiſhed together, to the reprouing of their folly, and reducement of many to the Church of God: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, in part only, in iudgement with ſuch. For I thinke that ſuch a courſe might perhaps be profitable with the iudicious and intelligent Papiſts, if they would take this as a principle with them, that, that Religion cannot be of God, which needeth to be ſupported and borne vp with lyes and fictions; which are of ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence in matters of religion, that as a holy Father hath ſaid, If but one lye only, could be found in the holy Scriptures, it would be ſufficient to diſcredit the whole. But as for their ſuperſtitious Idiots, who are delighted with nothing more, then ſuch vanities, I ſuppoſe by tryed experience, that little fruit would be gathered thereby. Such a worke (to publiſh ſuch a maſſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17944:173"/> of fooleries) would be exceeding laborious to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; all which may well be ſupplied, if painefull and zelous Miniſters, would with diſcretion and choice, eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones publiſh ſome of their fooleries in Pulpit; I ſaid with choice and diſcretion; becauſe I would wiſh that ſuch things ſhould be cited out of their owne Authours, who are full fraught therewith; and not taken out of ſuch trifling Pamphlets, as <hi>Plutoes</hi> trauailes, and ſuch like. I heartily wiſh that ſuch Preachers, at leaſt Doctors, who liue amongſt Popiſh or Semipopiſh people, would be more careful what imputations they lay againſt them. They are exceedingly ſcandalized, when any lyes or ſuch doctrine as they teach not, is imputed to them. A famous Predicant of a Funerall erred egregiouſly in this kinde within this yeere &amp;c. I was aſhamed to heare him &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot by the way but maruaile, with what wiſdome any man dare preſume to licence, vnder the ſhadow of Maieſtie, ſuch ſtuffe, which although in part true, yet for ſubſtance is vaine. But let the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and chriſtian Reader be perſwaded, that we neede not to deuiſe any thing in this kinde againſt our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, their workes are ſo repleniſhed with ſuch fooleries, againſt their owne principles of Religion; that a ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhall finde it a harder matter to relate them all, then to confute them; the firſt being impoſſible, the ſecond moſt facill and eaſie.</p>
                  <p>And here concluding, I giue the Reader to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that although lying ſignes, wonders, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in ſholes and multitudes, are ſignes and markes of Antichriſtianiſme, eſpecially in theſe later timer; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles the mighty hand of God doth neuer ſo forſake his Church, (to leaue altogether the rodds of ſinners vpon the ſhoulders of his ſeruants) but that ſometimes, hee doth with miraculous deliuerances aſſiſt them: but this he doth apparantly, openly, clearely, euen in the ſights,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17944:174"/> and to the confuſion of their Aduerſaries; whenas all their miracles, prodigies, wonders, are ſecret, hidden, from a farre of, by heare-ſay. For how elſe, but by the mightie hand of God, was the Church of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and defended in the time of King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and Pope <hi>Martin?</hi> who laboured and proiected by the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their powers, the ruine of that Chriſtian flocke? For my part I dare compare thoſe holy warres, of thoſe Chriſtians, with thoſe of the <hi>Machabies:</hi> yea, if we had them fully and perfectly recounted vnto vs, wee ſhould finde them to equallize, if not to excell their victories: what can we thinke, but that the right hand of God did powerfully ayde them, when their <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> renowned <hi>Iohannes Troſnoue</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ziſca,</hi> did eleuen ſeuerall times, notwithſtanding their huge forces, foyle and ouerthrow them? Was it done by meanes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtrength? no, no, our Aduerſaries will tell vs the contrarie. And to particularize in ſome, doth not Pope <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. in his Hiſtorie of <hi>Bohemia</hi> tell vs, that when a threefold potent Armie, was gathered againſt theſe poore Chriſtians, (a very handfull of ſouldiers) one out of all Saxonie, and the Territories thereunto adioyning; the ſecond out of rich and warlike <hi>Franconia;</hi> the third out of <hi>Bauyre, Sueuia,</hi> and the Prouinces of the <hi>Rheyne,</hi> with valiant Captaines appointed ouer them, did in three ſeuerall parts, with all violence aſſault thoſe poore Chriſtians, intending their vtter ruine: doth not (I ſay) Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond tell vs, that preſently vpon the ſight of the Chriſtians, (without doubt Gods terrour being in them) they did flee before them; yea (ſaith <hi>Pius) non viſum hoſtem fugerunt, before they ſaw the enemy, they fled,</hi> and flew ſo hard, that they ceaſed not to flee, vntill the Chriſtians ceaſed to purſue them; by occaſion whereof their bag and baggage was left to the Chriſtians, and an happie occaſion alſo giuen them to make ſpoile of many popiſh towns, &amp; to impoſe tributes vpon them.</p>

                  <p> Thus in effect Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> who yet relateth vnto, vs a more potent deliuerance of thoſe Chriſtians; for when vpon ſuch a ſhamefull ouerthrow, the Papiſts were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed; the Pope and Emperour together, gathered an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other greater (the greatneſſe whereof you may inferre, becauſe it had foure thouſand horſe in it) army, and then againe therewith aſſaulted them; but <hi>Iulian</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, who was generall for the Pope, ouer the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had no ſooner entred into the limits of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but preſently <hi>(totis caſtris trepidatum eſt, &amp; priuſqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoſtis vllus in conſpectu daretur, faeda fuga coepta) There fell a dread and trembling ouer the whole Campe, and before any enemy was to be ſeene, a filthy flight was begunne.</hi> Who did this, but the Lord of hoſtes? like as of old he did in the Campes of the <hi>Madianites,</hi> and <hi>Amalakites</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe <note place="margin">Iud. 7.</note> of his people. And this flight (notwithſtanding all, that the Cardinall could doe) gaue great ſpoile, and left infinite riches to the oppreſſed Chriſtians; and ſo ill was there ſucceſſe againſt that people of God, that <hi>ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt à bellis, there was a ceſſation of warre,</hi> and by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh cunning they did afterwards ſeeke to ſubuert them.

Now let all the Pontificians &amp; Ignatians lay their heads together, and giue me one inſtance of ſuch Chriſtian patience practiſed in their Churches; as I will ſhew pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by this Church, State, and Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> I meane that incomparable patience, meekeneſſe, and ſpirit of compaſſion, by which the Papiſts were tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to breathe in this Kingdome, vpon diſcouery of the Powder-treaſon: Had the like attempt beene acted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Popiſh dominions; fire and reuengeful ſword, would haue maſſacred not onely the Actors and Abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, but euen all thoſe, who by ſuſpicion, might haue beene thought to haue had any knowledge, conſent, or approuance of the ſame. And herein I dare ſpeake what I know, that many Papiſts (though otherwiſe, I dare ſay for them, innocent in the fact) did thereupon expect vtter ruine to themſelues and their religion: yea did not the Arch Traitour <hi>Garnet</hi> himſelfe preſage ſo much to his order, if the plot ſhould happen to bee diſcouered. Therefore let it ſtand proued, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is guided and directed by the Spirit of God, which could in ſuch a ſodaine, ſhew it ſelfe ſo mercifull and meeke, againſt ſuch who with <hi>ſangnefreddo</hi> cold bloud, as the Italian phraſe is, would make bon-fires with vs if wee were in their powers: and yet notwithſtanding, great-fauourers and receiuers of Ignatians there are,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17944:176"/> where the Foxes lye and lodge (who would haue laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if Weſtminſter had beene ouerturned) and who as yet, ſhadowed vnder pufft wings tiffiny, and fardingals, doe (as may be doubted) plot ſome like enterpriſes, to the ruine of this Church and Kingdome; but beware of ſecuritie, O yee Chriſtian <hi>Brittans!</hi> beware of ſecuritie.</p>
                  <p>Again, humility is laid as a ground-work for Chriſtian religion, to be built vpon; by which, humility, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit (not outward baſe garments, coules, weedes, girdles, in not ſparing of the fleſh) to vſe the Apoſtles phraſe, is to be vnderſtood: now this pouertie of ſpirit, <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 23.</note> muſt be eſpecially regarded towards God; whereof, the Papiſts are ſo depriued, that their very doctrine in one reſpect, leadeth them to that pride, and preſumption of ſpirit, which Chriſt deteſted in the Phariſee. Let all their Catechiſmes be ſearched, and they will define vnto you, that the ſinne of preſumption is, when a man looketh for ſaluation without merits (their owne merits they meane) by which doctrine, it is as cleere as noone dayes, that in reſpect of ſaluation, their Popiſh may, and ought to hope for the ſame, partly by their owne merits: and what is this elſe, but a kind of preſumption, euen to iuſtle with God? and with him to remember their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. But the reformed Churches, are ſo farre from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a man into this preſumption of his owne merits; that I may ſay it and truely ſaie it, that it is, as it were the ſumme of our holy Chriſtian, and Catholike doctrine, to bring a man to a perfect apprehenſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his manifolde iniquities and corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; &amp; by the acknowledging of the ſame, to bring him to ſuch an humiliation and depreſſion of himſelfe, and within himſelfe; that for remiſſion of his ſinnes, and ſaluation, he can looke for no other meanes, but the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alone merits of Chriſts death and paſſion (And yet this not without ſtore of Chriſtian good workes to admoniſh the wiſe, and cauilling Papiſts by the way) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17944:176"/> vnto his ſoule, by a liuing and ſincere faith; in which reſpect our Chriſtians are, or may bee euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in perfect humiliation of their ſoules, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>As for humilitie towards man, good God, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, that the Papiſts haue leſt thereof? to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize (though in time of perſecution as they pretend) do not they in excceſſe of apparell ſurpaſſe, at leaſt equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our worſt and diſorderedſt Proteſtants? I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard both <hi>Ignatian,</hi> and Secular Prieſts affirme, the exceſſe and curioſitie of faſhions, to haue beene farre worſe amongſt Papiſts then Proteſtants: and if they did not or would not affirme it, who ſeeth it not? whence I doe demand of the Papiſts, haue wee our daily innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faſhions? not from out of <hi>France?</hi> where, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> the vanity and exceſſe in apparell is too too vnmeaſurable; and for brauing oſtentation, what people vnder heauen come nigh by many degrees, to the <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perian</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>But to reflect vpon their firſt point of doctrine in this conſideration, by which they affirme that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the ſinne of preſumption, who hopeth for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without merits, it is ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſecuring their ſoules with Chriſtian comfort, that it doeth rather cauſe vnto them endleſſe afflictions, and torment of minde, which I could confirme by many examples out of their owne hiſtories. Neuertheleſſe to ſhew how pernicious this their doctrine is, for a man any whit to reſt vpon his owne merits, I will relate (perhaps a fable) onely one ſtory, <note place="margin">

A certaine holy Eremite, liuing in a deſert, being neere his end; ſendeth for a certaine Abbot dwelling neere by, to come vnto him and to houſell him: hee commeth, and vpon his comming, by the ringing of a certaine bell, a famous theefe and a notorious malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, draweth neere to the doore of this Eremites Sell;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17944:177"/> where ſeeing the Eremite vſing ſuch deuotion, he in his conceit thinking him to be a very holy and bleſſed man; wiſhed (ſo loudly, that the Eremite heard him) that hee were like vnto him in holineſſe; which wiſhing of the theefe, when the Eremite heard he contemned him, and ſaid within himſelfe, that he had well wiſhed, that he had beene in holineſſe like vnto himſelfe; and ſo continuing in ſuch kinde of thoughts of his owne merits, the Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite dyeth: vpon and for his death, the Monke that came along with the Abbot, greatly lamenteth; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning together with the Abbot, in the way they finde this theefe (of whom we ſpake before) ſodenly ſlaine by ſome wilde beaſt: at ſight of which heauy chance, the companion of the Abbot laugheth; for which, being reprehended by the Abbot, hee thus excuſeth himſelfe, that God had reuealed vnto him, the different endes of theſe two; of the Eremite, that he was damned, for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and contenting himſelfe in his owne iuſtice; and that was the cauſe, why he ſo heauily bewailed his death: of the theefe and malefactour, that he was ſaued, for that he did with humility acknowledge himſelfe a ſinner, and for ſaluation reſted and confided onely in the mercies of God; and that was the cauſe, why hee ſo greatly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at his death. This ſtory is related by <hi>Coſter,</hi> as many other like ones (to the reproouing of ſundry Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an poſitions) though he bringeth them againſt vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

                  <p> Againe, workes of charity intended and inſtituted for the releeuing of the poore, are great tokens of true Chriſtianity, when they are done purely and meerely for the loue of God. The Papiſts doe bragge much of this, but vainely; for taking quantity of time for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, there are who dare vndertake to ſhew as many workes of piety (eſpecially for hoſpitals and ſchooles of learning) done in the reformed Churches, as in any like time of popery: and yet ſuch as were done there with them, were done alwaies with conceit of merit; to cauſe Friers to pray for themſelues, or the ſouls of their friends departed; or were mixt with ſome like reſpect of ſelfe loue, whereas all like workes done in Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, haue beene done for no other end, but to releeue the poore, further godlineſſe, and pleaſe God, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine excluding all manner of merit, and hope therein, and all manner of feare of purgatory flaſhes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, a ſigne of true Chriſtianity, (eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world) is frequent and deuout me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in holy Scriptures, the which is ſo plentifully performed by zealous Chriſtians, ſuch as are touched with care of ſaluation, in the Reformed Churches; that there is no compariſon to bee made betwixt them and the Laikes of their Churches: who are ſo farre from daily meditating therein, that they dare not, nor may not, without ſpeciall leaue, read in vulgar tongues, any parts or parcels of the ſame, which cauſeth great ignorance of ſacred Scriptures in their Laikes: as alſo, the ignorance of their Clerkes therein is very groſſe, as by many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars might bee ſhewed one late one I will not heere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. There was of late (and yet perhaps is) conducted vp and downe London, a Champion of the Papiſts, by a certaine Knight: this Champion diſguiſed Caui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere-like, either by accident or of ſet purpoſe, is brought to the houſe of a certaine Knight, where entring into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation about the Sacrament, he went raſhly ſo farre,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17944:178"/> as to teach that the very fleſh of Chriſt is rent and torne in the Sacrament by the teeth of the receiuers. (Which his manner of ſpeech and defence, did not pleaſe the Knight his Guide and Leader, he holding the contrary.)

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader; about the time I had finiſht this my diſcourſe, it pleaſed a very Reuerend Father of this Church, the Right Reuerend Biſhop of Bathe and Wels, to ſhew me a petty tranſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine pamphlet in print, gloriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deckt with imagery repreſenting vnto the gazing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in pictures, the birth, life, attachment, arraignement and execution, of one <hi>Edmund Gennings,</hi> who together with one <hi>Swithune Wels</hi> (a merry Cricke, and <hi>boun Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion;)</hi> was according to the Iuſtice of the Lawes of this Kingdome, put to death in Grayes-Inne-fields, the yeere of our Lord God 1591. Hauing curſorily runne ouer the pamphlet, I ſhould haue reputed the ſame, the worke of ſome childiſh <hi>Punie,</hi> orignorant <hi>Wilſon;</hi> but that I obſerued cleerely by the two letters prefixed in the Front of the booke, and by ſome other circumſtances, very cleere, that the Authour of the ſame, was <hi>Iohn Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> a <hi>Reuerend</hi> Prieſt amongſt them, and Brother to Saint <hi>Edmund</hi> their pretenſed Martyr. Both theſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Edmund,</hi> were well knowen to me: concerning whom and the pamphlet, (the contents whereof doe ſo ſquare with the vanitie of Popiſh miracles I haue heere handled) I thought good to adde theſe few obſeruations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that neither <hi>Edmund</hi> nor <hi>Iohn</hi> conuerſing amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt their fellow Collegiates, were euer reputed to be of any note of Sanctity; what the learning of <hi>Iohn</hi> is, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

The learning of the <hi>Pſeudo-Martyr</hi> was verie ſmall, his ſhort ſtaying in the Colledge, not ſuffering him to be better furniſhed; and againe, the weakneſſe of his conſtitution was a great hinderance vnto him in that kinde; who otherwiſe alſo was not very capable of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. His daily infirmities were a cauſe that he was made <hi>Prefect</hi> of the <hi>Infirmarie</hi> (that is, appointed to bee an <hi>Ouerſeer</hi> of the ſicke) whereby hee was freed from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſcholaſticke burdens and duties which were inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to others: His effeminate conſtitution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, with carriage incident to the ſame, made him to be beloued of the bearded <hi>Iuuentus,</hi> yea and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his conſtitution was a reaſon, that hee was by diſpenſation made Prieſt before hee was 24. yeeres of age; for ſuch is their faſhion whom they finde <hi>precipitate</hi> for Englands miſſion; though they bee <hi>imberbes</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them away, by giuing vnto them the dignitie of Prieſt-hood: and no maruell that the Martyr haſted for England, whoſe daily ſickneſſe and continuall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, haſtened him to the graue in a ſtrange Countrey, if he had ſtayed at Rhemes any longer. This is all in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which can bee ſaid touching his carriage, for that ſmall time he was in the Colledge, and theſe bee the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of their Martyr, and I thinke that he who ſhall reade the pamphlet ſet out by his Brother, (who I doubt not did amplifie what he could, and ſet all his praiſes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tenter-hookes) may not finde any ſpeciall poynt worth noting, commending either his learning or his <hi>Sanctitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I obſerue, how they haue raſhly ſet him forth for ſo glorious a Martyr, I cannot but thinke of an other like Saint, who was ſent from <hi>Rhemes</hi> about the ſame time into <hi>England:</hi> This was one <hi>Waterſon,</hi> who whileſt <hi>Gennings</hi> was Prefect of the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> ſerued vnder one

This <hi>Waterſon</hi> being of a very rough conſtitution, fitter to make a Ploughman then a Scholler; ouergrown in yeares; not able to make good conſtruction in Latine; no, nor to expound ordinarie and vulgar Latine; being found not fit for <hi>Logicke</hi> ſubtelties, was put to ſtudy, their poſitiue <hi>Groſſeries,</hi> caſes of diuinitie I ſhould ſay: in which kinde of learning, he made ſuch ſpeedie progreſſe; that vpon a ſuddaine he was Prieſted &amp; ſent ouer into <hi>England;</hi> the which was not done without the offence and diſlike of diuerſe in the Colledge; and others in <hi>England</hi> alſo: ſuch was the mans ſufficiencie and his conuerſation, in good fellowſhip &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But obſerue what followeth; being come into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> ſo inconſiderate and <hi>Goodfellowlike</hi> was his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that he did not long eſcape the hands of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> &amp; being taken was according to the lawes executed for his demerites; whereupon their notes were ſo on a ſuddaine changed, concerning the ſanctitie of life, and glorie of the death of this their Martyr, that it was a wonder wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy laughter to heare them. Yea they were not aſhamed to giue out diuers rumours of miraculous accidents which happened before, at, and after his death; more then this our <hi>Pamphleter</hi> can, after ſo long conſideration finde out for his Saint-brother. Which conſidering I cannot but obſerue this point, that it mattereth not with the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Aſſecles,</hi> of what life and conuerſation their Saints be, ſo it can be prooued that they die ſtoutly and obſtinately, for the teſtimonie of his vnlimited ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie: and it is worthy noting, that they doe moſt exalt and extoll thoſe feruent and fiery Spirits, who doe giue to their <hi>Romane Ioue</hi> abſolute power to depoſe and dethrone Princes; and do ſpeake very coldly, of ſuch

            <p>And here, I aduiſe the weake <hi>Reader,</hi> or any that may be popiſhly affected; not to prize too highly this promptneſſe in popiſh Prieſts to ſuffer death for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their <hi>Vice-Chriſt.</hi> There were of old the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellions</hi>

            <p>The learned and vnlearned cannot be ignorant, but that many Ancient worthies, Greeke, and Romane, Infidel and faithfull, haue by daily meditation of deaths power and the ſting thereof, and by conſideration of the benefits, that ariſe from honorable deaths, ſo armed their mindes, againſt the terrours of death, that neither death her ſelfe, nor the immanitie of moſt cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could euer containe them, from atchiuing, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting ſuch honourable enterpriſes, in which, they ſaw their glorious memories, ſhould remaine regiſtred for all future poſterities.

            </p>
            <p>I doe ſpecially note, that the condition of popiſh Martyrs of theſe times; was liuely forelineated in the <hi>Martirians;</hi> who ſo gloried in the number of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, that for their bragging in this kinde, Antiquitie

What a vanitie is this? it were a ſinne to looſe time in refuting of it: many there haue been borne with a tooth or teeth in their head, and yet no <hi>omen</hi> made thereof. There was in my Pariſh of <hi>Ebbenye</hi> in Kent, a woman borne with two teeth in her mouth, yet ſhee neuer tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed beyond one or two Seas, neither fell it out, that ſhee was any great comfort to her Parents; ſhee is dead and hath left behinde her, children to her husband, for whoſe teeth he is put carefully to prouide; and this was the <hi>Omen</hi> of hir two teeth. And I thinke (if all be true I haue heard) <hi>Mr. Gennings</hi> mother tooke no comfort but great griefe at her Sonnes returne, though not ſo great, as the mother of <hi>Garnet</hi> (the younger executed at Tyburne) did; for ſhee hearing of her Sonnes death, therevpon came to be diſtracted in her witts.

Here I wiſh the Reader to weigh, vnto what ſhifts theſe <hi>auguring</hi> Papiſts are driuen; to mee, it is a moſt cleare argument of the badneſſe of their cauſe, that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17944:182"/> they do ſo hunt after prodigies and miracles for the ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſecond wonder I obſerue in this Pamphlet, is, <note place="margin">The Martyrs ſecond miracle</note> another Prodigie, <hi>ſi dijs placet.</hi> His belly being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his bowells cut out, and his heart in the <hi>Executioners</hi> hand, yet the Martyr cryeth out, <hi>Sancte Gregori ora pro me.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Marie,</hi> haue beene prodigiouſly and miraculouſly deliuered: all theſe things are feigned to bring the worſhip of the <hi>Creature</hi> in ſteed of the <hi>Creator.</hi> But this which your <hi>Gennings</hi> did, what was it more or aboue that which is ordinarie with ſuperſtitious, languiſhing, and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſoules in the agonie of death? what elſe was this then an argument that life was not quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor his ſoule departed, when the <hi>Executioner</hi> had your <hi>Martyrs</hi> heart in his hand? I hope <hi>M.

Yea more, this miracle was not onely not ſhewed to the people; but it was by miracle, yea by as many miracles, as there were perſons there preſent to behold it, (and yet did not or could not behold it) the ſame was miraculouſly hid from them: and for this I note thirdly, that whereas the ſtanders by did not obſerue or could not obſerue the miraculous parting of the thumbe from the hand, the ſame is to be imputed to Gods ſpeciall power (or to the diuels miniſtery by Gods permiſſion) by which their ſenſes were bound; or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome miſt caſt before them; or elſe thirdly the virgin and the thumbe were made ſtrangely and prodigiouſlie inuiſible, ſo that the ſtanders by could not <hi>apertis oculis,</hi> behold ſo ſenſible and apparant an action done before them and in their ſight.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17944:185"/> of Maſter <hi>Gennings,</hi> I doubt not to affirme, but that his <hi>Virgin laſſe</hi> hath played a tricke of <hi>legerdemaine,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Brothers thombe; to which his tale I thinke, that as much credit may be giuen, as to the merry <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe Prieſt,</hi> who comming out of <hi>Greece</hi> pretended to haue brought with him <hi>Moſes</hi> hornes, which hee wore when hee deſcended from <hi>Mount Sina:</hi> or elſe, to that merry Frier who proferred to ſhew in a box, as an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable relike, one of the holy Ghoſts fingers.</p>
            <p>What then ſhall we ſay to this pretenſed finger of this Virgin maide, whence had ſhee it? or what might it bee? may wee ſay, that becauſe the <hi>Lowe-countries</hi> was the place, where ſhe firſt vented her Saints <hi>thombe,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe might haue lighted there, vpon ſome one fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thoſe, which the mercileſſe, inhumane and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were wonted to cut from the hands of thoſe people; for greedineſſe to haue their rings?

            <p>Or ſhall we ſay, that it might bee a thombe of ſome one other of their <hi>Prieſts-Martyrs</hi> here at <hi>Tiburne?</hi> or elſe a thombe taken from ſome body, appointed for the Anatomiſts.
